Last Friday we approached our front door with trepidation after six weeks away, most recently flat-sitting for yet more generous holidaying friends.

Our oak patio doors are installed, and the single rear door (added to create a fire escape for the new loft) has now had its frame built.\n\nAnd most excitingly, gamely pumping out heat next to the partly boarded up doorway, is a real, working radiator. Oh joy! It’s just a temporary setup, but it means there’s a bit of warmth for the builders and a cosy bedroom for us.

You would have thought we’d have learnt from the sofa experience (see our first post), but somehow we managed to order a bath that was too big for the front door. And the bathroom door. So the long-suffering builders had to carry it through next-door’s house, over the fence, into our place and through hole in the floor up to the bathroom. But it is a really quite splendid bath, as you can see. We also have a fully functioning loo for the first time in a very long time. The only slight hazard is the fact that there’s only half a landing, so we have to take care not to plummet to our deaths when caught short in the middle of the night.\n\nThe loft hasn’t really been tackled yet, but an exploratory hole has been hacked out, and already a steady stream of Victorian-era coal dust is making its way into our world. It’s looking like the space is going to be a smaller one than we’d imagined – probably a single bedroom, because of the restricted ceiling space (we couldn’t go for a dormer because it’s a conservation area). It might seem like a lot of effort for not much return, but as we’re converting one bedroom into a bathroom this is really the only way to preserve the value of the house. We’re hoping a lick of paint and some cunning lighting will do the trick. It’s all about optical illusions.\n\nThe finish line is getting closer. We can smell it. Or is that the Victorian coal dust?

Haringey Council==\n\nLiving in a conservation area is reassuring, as it means we probably won't have a 20 story council block built on our street in the immediate future. On the other hand, it does mean that Haringey Council keeps an eagle eye on any tweaking the good people of Noel Park do to their houses. They're especially anal about the bits you can see from the street, but even with our little rear extension they're making us jump through all sort of hoops.\n\nIn May when we moved in, we looked at the rusted-through radiators, groaning boiler and rotting floorboards, and naively assumed we'd have all our renovation work done by the winter. Now that's looking a tad unlikely. To cut a long story short, we were wrongly advised to apply for a *certificate of lawfulness*, ie. *planning permission lite*. It's a document stating that the work falls under the definition of the government's *permitted development* - small stuff you can do without planning permission. And after waiting for 8 weeks, we got some frustrating news.\n\nAaaargh! Apparently, our extension is 75cm longer than the maximum length (3m). I mean, REALLY. And because we want glass doors all the way along the back of the house, we can't just chop a bit off. So what this means is that we have had to fill in a gazillion new forms and apply for full planning permission, which will take ANOTHER 8 weeks.\n\nSince the building work will take 2-3 months, it looks like we won't have heating or hot water until November at the earliest.

Haringey Council</mark></p>\n\n<p>Living in a conservation area is reassuring, as it means we probably won't have a 20 story council block built on our street in the immediate future. On the other hand, it does mean that Haringey Council keeps an eagle eye on any tweaking the good people of Noel Park do to their houses. They're especially anal about the bits you can see from the street, but even with our little rear extension they're making us jump through all sort of hoops.</p>\n\n<p>In May when we moved in, we looked at the rusted-through radiators, groaning boiler and rotting floorboards, and naively assumed we'd have all our renovation work done by the winter. Now that's looking a tad unlikely. To cut a long story short, we were wrongly advised to apply for a <em>certificate of lawfulness</em>, ie. <em>planning permission lite</em>. It's a document stating that the work falls under the definition of the government's <em>permitted development</em> - small stuff you can do without planning permission. And after waiting for 8 weeks, we got some frustrating news.</p>\n\n<p>Aaaargh! Apparently, our extension is 75cm longer than the maximum length (3m). I mean, REALLY. And because we want glass doors all the way along the back of the house, we can't just chop a bit off. So what this means is that we have had to fill in a gazillion new forms and apply for full planning permission, which will take ANOTHER 8 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Since the building work will take 2-3 months, it looks like we won't have heating or hot water until November at the earliest. We're trying to stay zen and think about the gas bill savings.</p>\n\n<p>But there is another silver lining.

Chapter 1 done.\n\nWith Tim’s book behind me (and frankly, already almost mostly forgotten thanks to my terrible information retention) and Rob’s first chapter fresh in my memory, it’s time to roll up our sleeves.\n\n# Tips to keep in mind for the future\n\nHere are a few short tips to get started with:\n![eye on the ball](/content/images/2016/11/eye_on_the_ball1.png)\n\n* **Don’t get side-tracked.** Stay consistently productive. Ask yourself “Is what I’m doing right now beneficial to a task/goal?”. Keep you eye on the ball.\n* **Take notes and document.** Extract useful bits from everything you read and encounter and discard the rest. If your new venture has a recurring theme, a repeating process, make an effort to document the steps. Imagine your clone has to step in and take over – the documentation needs to be readily available.\n* **Write better code/sell a simple product.** Don’t release something you have to support. Imagine SMS alerts at 3AM, support emails, 1st/2nd line support calls. This is your first venture, so best keep it simple. Even if you release a top-notch product, you will never be done.\n* **Work hard, play hard and never kill time.** Put away the iPhone when having a pint with your mates. If the book you’re reading sucks, chuck it. Wasting time is bad. Carry a notebook or informative magazine for those odd occasions when you have to queue at the Post Office, unless queue-time is Angry-Birds-on-your-iPhone-time.\n* **Learn things relevant to your venture, where it matters.** Don’t learn Photoshop and CSS if you’re not a designer – such things can be easily outsourced (think [Virtual Assistants](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=virtual+assistants) and [elance](http://elance.com)). But, you should probably start reading [Marketing For Dummies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marketing-Dummies-UK-Craig-Smith/dp/0764570560) and get yourself familiarised with SEO. Start thinking like a manager (ROI) and an entrepreneur (long-term vision).\n* **Don’t mourn your mistakes.** Fail fast, learn, and recover quickly. You’re secret weapon as a one-man show is reaction time.\n\n# Preparation\n\n## Tools\n\n* **Google Docs** (for summarising and capturing long-lived data)\n* **Evernote** (for jotting down ideas, voice memos, photos, and then later porting to Google Docs)\n\nIf you’re going to tackle a project, then you need the right tools. I’m going to use [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) and [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) to capture ideas with, keep track of expenditure, capture inspiring articles, etc. One document detailing my goals. One spreadsheet detailing everything I’ve spent on my venture thus far. You can argue the case for tools like Delicious Bookmarks, but Evernote already allows you to capture links. And since we’re trying to stay focused, only “inspirational” links and links relevant to your goals will be saved here. Delicious Bookmarks will be a distraction since you use it to capture other URLs with (oh, Slashdot – how you’ve eaten my time).\n\n## Goals\n\nWriting down your goals is the first thing you need to do. My goal is extra cash. More specifically, here’s an excerpt from my Google Doc entitled “Goals”:\n\n<pre>\nGoals:\n  Money.\nShort term: (3 months)\n  * Make £100 per month profit from a start-up\nMedium term: (9 months)\n  * Make  £500 per month profit from a start-up\nLong term: (2 years)\n  * Financial independence\n  * Location independence\n  * Equity (possibly sell a profitable website on flippa.com)\nCommon:\n  * Still have enough time to spend with family and extend our home\n    (i.e. possibly turn down lots of opportunities)\n  * Self-funded (not venture funded)\n</pre>\n\n\nSince I already have a day job, I decided to be conservative. £500/month in 9 months time is probably not much, but I’m sure I’ll achieve it. Note that I didn’t put down “To have fun” as a goal; the code I write for my employer provides me with hours of pleasure already, and since I’ve never done the startup thing, I don’t know if it will be *fun*. Hence cash, but in the [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html) sense.\n\n# It will be hard\n\nStaying focused will be hard. Put your goals on your bedroom wall. Look at them every day. Share your progress with someone who gives a damn so that you can be somewhat accountable for your progress.\n\nAlready I’m thinking that writing about it is a massive waste of time. Earlier, when I wrote about Google Docs and Evernote, I mentioned Delicious Bookmarks and *ALMOST* got sidetracked finding better alternatives to it. I stopped and thought “Is this necessary?”.\n\nI’ve used Delicious for years, and I don’t care if there are better alternatives AND it isn’t relevant because it’s not in my tool set. Easy. Done. 15 seconds later I’m not distracted and back on track. Since I’m no great writer, I’ve already spent an hour on this post, and I’m panicking, thinking that this is turning into a distraction. But, getting public visibility on my venture will keep me going. I won’t silently give up and find solace in Resident Evil and crisps.\n\n# Now what?\n\nI’ve done a lot of writing and, I’m armed with one or two things to do. Future posts will follow a “yesterday; today; tomorrow; lessons learned” format. What I need to do tonight/tomorrow, is:\n\n* figure out if my idea (behind locked doors for the time being) is viable. I’m taking inspiration from [Lindsey Harper](http://harperlindsey.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/how-i-used-amazons-mechanical-turk-to-validate-my-startup-idea/) and will upload a small survey to [Amazon’s Mechanical Turk](http://mturk.com/). Heck, I may even get a VA (Virtual Assistant) to draw one up for me.\n* start talking to people. A mate of mine recently sold his £600/month “mp3 amplifiers” (talk about niche!) website to an eBayer for £6000. He’s onto his next idea and, I’ve booked a lunch with him to pick his brain. I’m also going to arrange to interview the top execs at the company I work for, especially the marketers.\n* familiarise myself with Google Adwords and SEO – something I’ve been spared thus far as a pure Java developer.\n\nIt’s 9h30PM, and I’ve got my work cut out for me.

If I’m still not happy after this, I’ll start paying the one-off charges to find better alternatives. (DISCLAIMER: The “NOs” below is not an indication of bad service; they just don’t satisfy my initial “do it for free initially” criteria.)\n\n# The NOs\n\n**Get Friday** aka “Your man in India” has a nice ring to it and [research](https://www.getfriday.com/?module=services&action=servicelist#10) was one of the services they offered, but they charge a once-off EUR 7.50 fee for subsequent PAYG services. I don’t want to spend any money just yet.\n\n**Elance** has a once-off [$10 activation fee](http://www.elance.com/p/how-it-works.html).\n\n**American Express Platinum Card Concierge** is [akin to having a personal butler](https://www124.americanexpress.com/cards/platinum/concierge.jsp) and not suited to my purposes (yet ;-)\n\n**Do My Stuff** mentioned that contractors [pay to bid for your task](http://www.domystuff.com/static.php?cmd=features) and since it wasn’t made clear that they’ll be refunded if you change your mind, I marked this a no.\n\n**Amazon’s Mechanical Turk** will come in handy as a [crowdsourcing tool](http://mturk.com/) to answer my survey, so I leave this one for later.\n\n**Ask Sunday** has a [free trial](https://www.asksunday.com/signup/index.php?service=TwentyFourSeven) and when I clicked on the promotion, a chat window popped up. I humoured myself with this for a while to see if they make a good first impression. A friendly salesperson called Rajesh informed me (in perfect English) that I can participate in the week trial and make three requests during this period. However, the first registration page popped up a disconcerting message (“There was a problem retrieving the data:”), so I decided not to trust them with my credit card information.\n\n# The yesses\n\n**ODesk** enabled me to quickly navigate to a [market research and surveys](http://www.odesk.com/contractors/sales-marketing/sc/market-research-surveys/) section. On first glance, I could see market researchers from India charging between $2.78 and $6.67 for an hour’s work. Since ODesk allowed me to post a job and interview contractors for free, I marked this one as a yes.\n\n**Craigslist** is [easy to use, free and everyone knows it](http://craigslist.com/). I posted a short ad.\n\nI figured this was enough to get me started.\n\n# How it worked out\n\nI posted a job on **ODesk** offering a once-off payment of $8, asking the potential contractor to compile a viability survey from the idea I propose. According to **ODesk**, about 14 people fitted my requirements (based on skill level, pay rate, and so forth).\n\nThe contractor I targeted rejected me, but a contractor called ‘K’ took the bait. I invited ‘K’ for an interview because he/she had some mobile development experience and I thought it a bonus to involve someone who understands this market.\n\nHowever, after a few email to-and-fros, it turns out that ‘K’ is just interested in developing a mobile application for me. I revised everything: $8 is sufficient for what should not take more than 10 minutes to do; my job wording was clear; my requirements weren’t too steep (e.g. 4 out of 5-star rating and basic English required). Have a look for yourself:\n\n![Result of posting a job on ODesk](/content/images/2016/11/odesk.png)\n\nI also posted a task on **Craigslist**‘s UK site. I worded it the same as before, and the fixed price is £5. No replies thus far.\n\n## I am a sweatshop boss\n\nAt this point, I still lacked a survey. With a day already behind me, I quickly whipped up one by myself and put two versions of it (one for the USA and one for the UK – a fair representation of my target markets) on **Amazon’s Mechanical Turk**. The possible total cost is $17.60 (i.e. 17.60 divided by 200 HITs is **0.088** cents per HIT, and you only pay for work completed).\n\nAdmittedly, it’s quite exciting seeing the results trickling in :-) I did feel like a sweatshop boss when I realised my effective rate is $1.43 per hour, though. I find solace in the idea that surveyor #3, a 28-year-old female from the USA, was clicking idly through Mechanical Turk while speaking to her mum on the phone.\n\n## The end-user\n\nWith my invisible human bots churning away at my survey, I have to start thinking what I’ll do with the results once I have it. The results will give me a good idea of who my end-user will be. My customers. My market.\n\nAs a geek who has been programming computers since ’92 and hacking at electronics even earlier, I have never had the business inkling. Bill Hicks makes taking sides even easier:\n\n<iframe width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tvp97SMZc6M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n([Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo) was deleted. If all else fails, search YouTube for \"Bill Hicks Marketing\")\n\nMarketing is all new ground to me. I put “marketing” and “marketing 101″ into Google and scanned the first few sites. I read the reviews for 5 or so top hits on Amazon. I learnt about the 4 Ps (product, promotion, price, placement). [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) popped up once or twice. A lot of information. Mastering marketing will be an ongoing journey, but for now, I’ll do the following two things:\n\n* **be the customer.** We all have years of experience of being the customer. Use it. Imagine you are surveyor #3 and cater the product accordingly. As I learn more about marketing, I’ll mirror the concepts onto my perceptions of the 4 Ps (the products I love, the promotions I partake in, the price I'm  willing to pay, and where I’ve seen my product).\n* **Google Adwords.** It’s widely used and understood. There are alternatives, but time is short. I’ve just created an account and will scan the help section, tips and forums. Google already highlights some of the key concepts of marketing in their documentation, so I can already combine theory with application.\n\n# TODO\n\nRight. My Turk is working. Once I have my results I’ll need to start testing the market. I’ll have to start thinking about creating 1-page websites with well-defined keywords, click counters, mailers and so forth. That will be a good indicator if the Turk lied or not, or if I bodged my placement and keywords.\n\nI have lunch with my business friend tomorrow to pick his brain, and an SEO mate of mine said she’ll chat to me later this week.\n\nHere goes:\n\n* wait for the Turk to finish filling out my survey\n* start on some rough one pager websites and get a designer/creative involved. Branding comes to mind.\n* start Chapter 2 of Rob’s book\n\nI’ll probably catch up with you guys again next week.

I read the reviews for 5 or so top hits on Amazon. I learnt about the 4 Ps (product, promotion, price, placement). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</a> popped up once or twice. A lot of information. Mastering marketing will be an ongoing journey, but for now, I’ll do the following two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>be the customer.</strong> We all have years of experience of being the customer. Use it. Imagine you are surveyor #3 and cater the product accordingly. As I learn more about marketing, I’ll mirror the concepts onto my perceptions of the 4 Ps (the products I love, the promotions I partake in, the price I'm  willing to pay, and where I’ve seen my product).</li>\n<li><strong>Google Adwords.</strong> It’s widely used and understood. There are alternatives, but time is short. I’ve just created an account and will scan the help section, tips and forums. Google already highlights some of the key concepts of marketing in their documentation, so I can already combine theory with application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"todo\">TODO</h1>\n\n<p>Right. My Turk is working. Once I have my results I’ll need to start testing the market. I’ll have to start thinking about creating 1-page websites with well-defined keywords, click counters, mailers and so forth. That will be a good indicator if the Turk lied or not, or if I bodged my placement and keywords.</p>\n\n<p>I have lunch with my business friend tomorrow to pick his brain, and an SEO mate of mine said she’ll chat to me later this week.</p>\n\n<p>Here goes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>wait for the Turk to finish filling out my survey</li>\n<li>start on some rough one pager websites and get a designer/creative involved.

I’m 12 again, and we’re having the usual Saturday afternoon al fresco stir-fry at my maternal grandfather’s house. My mum’s six siblings and their partners are there, as well as all my partners in crime (aka cousins).\n\nWe’re swimming, eating and soaking up the sun. The adults are having deep conversations over a beer. The kids are running around, yelling, jumping in the water.\n\nMy uncle, a welder, is busy cooking a heap of chicken strips. Always hungry, I walk over for a mouthful. “Hey, little buddy”, he says. “I had this idea I wanted to tell you about since I heard that welding would be one of your subjects in high school next year.”\n\nWell, yeah — mostly electronics and that kind of thing, but since I’m a sucker for a good idea, I briefly forgot about the swimming pool for a while.\n\nHis glasses sat on his browned, greasy face as he went on, eyes always flickering with curiosity.\n\n> So, I’m thinking of doing a range of metal tables that you can adjust. See, if you feel like standing up, then you flick a switch, and the table comes up to your level\n\n...he says as he squats and comes back up, right-hand level with his chest while his left hand is still holding the spatula.\n\nAt this point, my 32-year-old psyche starts materialising in my head. You know — when things in your dream start to feel out of place: you flick a light switch, and the light doesn’t turn on, or you pinch yourself but feel nothing.\n\nLuckily, instead of focusing, then focusing so much that I wake up (here’s looking at you, lucid dreamers), I ease into the idea just presented to me. I allow myself to be blinded by the sun’s glare on the swimming pool, and I allow my mind to swim.\n\n> But, yeah — I talked to a few people, and everyone says it’s crazy.\n\n*No, it's a brilliant idea! Trust me on this one.*\n\n> They say that they’ll look silly standing up next to a high table in the office.\n\n*Don’t be silly — it’s a great relief from sitting down for hours on end!*\n\nI divert my gaze from the glare back to his glasses.\n\n> They say that it may be unstable and that the monitor may fall off.\n\n*I know this is 1992 and that monitors weigh a tonne, but soon everyone will be a programmer, and everyone will start spending HOURS IN FRONT OF THEIR COMPUTERS!*\n\nOh no, my eyes are focusing…\n\n> So, I thought ‘nah’. But, it’s still a neat idea, no?\n\n*YES! Build me one! Just do it!*\n\n...my 32-year-old self screamed, but there were no words other than those in my dream head. My eyes focus more… No, stop focusing!\n\nDamn.\n\n**I wake up**\n\nNow, where have I seen this before? Oh, yes — [geek desk](http://www.geekdesk.com/).\n\nAnd right there I made the following realisation:\n\n==If you’re ever the proud owner of a good idea, and you start doubting yourself, try and believe in it so much as if your future self came back in time to tell you that this idea is great, and to **stick with it**.==\n\nOr let's look at it from the other perspective: Take one of your favourite Good Ideas. Like Google or Yammer. Go back in time. Let's say 1998. Just enough for the idea to be useful and relevant, but not too far for it to be totally alien. Present the idea to your young self. But, believe in it SO MUCH that you convince your young self to go and build it. (This is easy because you’ve seen Google and Yammer first-hand).\n\nIf you could go back to 1995¹ with the knowledge you have right now, which idea would you work on? And knowing what you know today, you'll probably try a bit harder and laugh at the naysayers.\n\nI suppose this is what people call “vision”. It takes someone with equal amounts of brains and crazy to religiously stick with something in such a way.\n\n> Trust me on this one. ;-)\n\n¹ *I guess Perl will still be The Hammer and every web problem will be The Nail, so better brush up on some Perl ;-)*","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <mark>A dream reminded me that you have to believe in yourself regardless of what others say.</mark></p>\n\n<p>In my dream, I recount a conversation I had with one of my uncles.

The adults are having deep conversations over a beer. The kids are running around, yelling, jumping in the water.</p>\n\n<p>My uncle, a welder, is busy cooking a heap of chicken strips. Always hungry, I walk over for a mouthful. “Hey, little buddy”, he says. “I had this idea I wanted to tell you about since I heard that welding would be one of your subjects in high school next year.”</p>\n\n<p>Well, yeah — mostly electronics and that kind of thing, but since I’m a sucker for a good idea, I briefly forgot about the swimming pool for a while.</p>\n\n<p>His glasses sat on his browned, greasy face as he went on, eyes always flickering with curiosity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, I’m thinking of doing a range of metal tables that you can adjust. See, if you feel like standing up, then you flick a switch, and the table comes up to your level</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...he says as he squats and comes back up, right-hand level with his chest while his left hand is still holding the spatula.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, my 32-year-old psyche starts materialising in my head. You know — when things in your dream start to feel out of place: you flick a light switch, and the light doesn’t turn on, or you pinch yourself but feel nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, instead of focusing, then focusing so much that I wake up (here’s looking at you, lucid dreamers), I ease into the idea just presented to me. I allow myself to be blinded by the sun’s glare on the swimming pool, and I allow my mind to swim.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, yeah — I talked to a few people, and everyone says it’s crazy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>No, it's a brilliant idea! Trust me on this one.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They say that they’ll look silly standing up next to a high table in the office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Don’t be silly — it’s a great relief from sitting down for hours on end!</em></p>\n\n<p>I divert my gaze from the glare back to his glasses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They say that it may be unstable and that the monitor may fall off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I know this is 1992 and that monitors weigh a tonne, but soon everyone will be a programmer, and everyone will start spending HOURS IN FRONT OF THEIR COMPUTERS!</em></p>\n\n<p>Oh no, my eyes are focusing…</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, I thought ‘nah’. But, it’s still a neat idea, no?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>YES! Build me one! Just do it!</em></p>\n\n<p>...my 32-year-old self screamed, but there were no words other than those in my dream head. My eyes focus more… No, stop focusing!</p>\n\n<p>Damn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I wake up</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, where have I seen this before? Oh, yes — <a href=\"http://www.geekdesk.com/\">geek desk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And right there I made the following realisation:</p>\n\n<p><mark>If you’re ever the proud owner of a good idea, and you start doubting yourself, try and believe in it so much as if your future self came back in time to tell you that this idea is great, and to <strong>stick with it</strong>.</mark></p>\n\n<p>Or let's look at it from the other perspective: Take one of your favourite Good Ideas. Like Google or Yammer. Go back in time. Let's say 1998. Just enough for the idea to be useful and relevant, but not too far for it to be totally alien. Present the idea to your young self. But, believe in it SO MUCH that you convince your young self to go and build it. (This is easy because you’ve seen Google and Yammer first-hand).</p>\n\n<p>If you could go back to 1995¹ with the knowledge you have right now, which idea would you work on? And knowing what you know today, you'll probably try a bit harder and laugh at the naysayers.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose this is what people call “vision”. It takes someone with equal amounts of brains and crazy to religiously stick with something in such a way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Trust me on this one. ;-)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>¹ <em>I guess Perl will still be The Hammer and every web problem will be The Nail, so better brush up on some Perl ;-)</em></p>","amp":null,"image":"/content/images/2016/11/family-bbq.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-11-15T12:40:40.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-11-15T12:54:17.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2012-01-17T12:40:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":2547,"uuid":"677a1937-9482-4fb9-b850-2b5cf0bb2e17","title":"Read Receipts for the rest of us","slug":"read-receipts-for-the-rest-of-us","markdown":"Or, more correctly: Read Receipts for geeks who use [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) and/or [Growl](http://growl.info/).\n\n# Read receipt\n\nSo, the Interwebs is down, or the proxy is packing up, or you can’t log in to server X, or <insert general technical issue here>.

I got no responses and hence thought that either\n\n* my question was posed incorrectly\n* the field is so new that no-one can really answer me\n* the race is on to lay the groundwork and therefore there’s no time to get a newbie up to speed\n* X. (I don’t know what X is yet.)\n\nFast-forward 3 years and I now have a project going which may or may not generate some valuable data soon. I want to store the data in a way that makes sense for humans and computers alike. I do not want to index everything because being presented with a list of 10 close matches to what you want is so archaic. And since I’m a big fan of free PaaS hosting plans, the data needs to be stored very efficiently, and I should be able to operate on it every efficiently. Besides, [your Big Data is big enough](http://www.information-management.com/blogs/big-data-size-mass-velocity-10022886-1.html), so I should be OK.\n\nWithout further ado, I’ve dedicated my evening to a Deep Dive of everything semweb.\n\nI love the web and am a web programmer. I also want to give meaning to my data, i.e. attach some semantics. Roll on.\n\n# Overview\n\nI started this post at 7, and now it’s 11. I got stuck on a [handful of Wikipedia articles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) and [W3C](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) recommendations and working groups. It all reminded me of this XKCD on standards:\n\n![XKCD #927](/content/images/2016/11/standards.png)\n\nAfter hours of randomly clicking and reading bits and pieces, I’ve managed to get a better overview of the state of semweb.\n\n# And then a funny thing happened\n\nAt this point I was supposed to write about it all, dissect it, make sense of it and summarise it.\n\nI was going to give you a primer on simple terms like taxonomy, vocabulary, and ontology. I was going to tell you how we’re still far away from data and still very much document-based, stuck in silos, and how traditional markup doesn’t cut it—how it does not describe what something means, how [microformats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat) is a web-based approach to semantic markup, and how this proliferation of formats can luckily be ground down into something coherent using [GRDDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRDDL). Most importantly, I was going to tell you about [knowledge representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) using OWL and RDF, and the software tools to peruse said formats.\n\nThen I realised: I crammed my brain with 4 hours worth of reading all this stuff that I need to find a way to do exactly that: **a knowledge representation of what’s in my brain**.\n\nThen something in my head went *snap*.\n\nI ended up on the floor in a spasmodic fit of hilarity, sucking my thumb. The confusion punctured my prefrontal cortex, and I now only speak to uppity wooden chairs. In reverse. My brain turned on itself in the most meta way possible. I had to stop.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI don’t want to duplicate any knowledge here, so there will be no summaries. But, I’ve seen the suffering, and will leave with you the following tips:\n\n* if you ever publish anything, and it’s not data, please [annotate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_RDF) it for [generations to come](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). The web is too noisy to scrape anything anymore, and we’re too busy to build a spider to make sense of your mash of markup.\n* there are [places](http://answers.semanticweb.com/) where you can ask questions if you get stuck.\n* don’t silo your data or think it belongs to you especially if your users created it (here’s looking at you, Facebook). [It should be free.](http://vibrantdata.org/)\n* don’t break the web by creating user profiles and not annotating it with [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) at the very least. There’s also [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/) and [XFN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML_Friends_Network).\n* don’t expect silver bullets. Smart people are doing good things to take this movement forward, like [http://www.opencalais.com/](http://www.opencalais.com/) (even though OC are too focused on companies/mergers news)\n* there are too many standards for me to consume right now.

I got no responses and hence thought that either</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>my question was posed incorrectly</li>\n<li>the field is so new that no-one can really answer me</li>\n<li>the race is on to lay the groundwork and therefore there’s no time to get a newbie up to speed</li>\n<li>X. (I don’t know what X is yet.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fast-forward 3 years and I now have a project going which may or may not generate some valuable data soon. I want to store the data in a way that makes sense for humans and computers alike. I do not want to index everything because being presented with a list of 10 close matches to what you want is so archaic. And since I’m a big fan of free PaaS hosting plans, the data needs to be stored very efficiently, and I should be able to operate on it every efficiently. Besides, <a href=\"http://www.information-management.com/blogs/big-data-size-mass-velocity-10022886-1.html\">your Big Data is big enough</a>, so I should be OK.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, I’ve dedicated my evening to a Deep Dive of everything semweb.</p>\n\n<p>I love the web and am a web programmer. I also want to give meaning to my data, i.e. attach some semantics. Roll on.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"overview\">Overview</h1>\n\n<p>I started this post at 7, and now it’s 11. I got stuck on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data\">handful of Wikipedia articles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/\">W3C</a> recommendations and working groups. It all reminded me of this XKCD on standards:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/11/standards.png\" alt=\"XKCD #927\" /></p>\n\n<p>After hours of randomly clicking and reading bits and pieces, I’ve managed to get a better overview of the state of semweb.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"andthenafunnythinghappened\">And then a funny thing happened</h1>\n\n<p>At this point I was supposed to write about it all, dissect it, make sense of it and summarise it.</p>\n\n<p>I was going to give you a primer on simple terms like taxonomy, vocabulary, and ontology. I was going to tell you how we’re still far away from data and still very much document-based, stuck in silos, and how traditional markup doesn’t cut it—how it does not describe what something means, how <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat\">microformats</a> is a web-based approach to semantic markup, and how this proliferation of formats can luckily be ground down into something coherent using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRDDL\">GRDDL</a>. Most importantly, I was going to tell you about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning\">knowledge representation</a> using OWL and RDF, and the software tools to peruse said formats.</p>\n\n<p>Then I realised: I crammed my brain with 4 hours worth of reading all this stuff that I need to find a way to do exactly that: <strong>a knowledge representation of what’s in my brain</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Then something in my head went <em>snap</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up on the floor in a spasmodic fit of hilarity, sucking my thumb. The confusion punctured my prefrontal cortex, and I now only speak to uppity wooden chairs. In reverse. My brain turned on itself in the most meta way possible. I had to stop.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>I don’t want to duplicate any knowledge here, so there will be no summaries. But, I’ve seen the suffering, and will leave with you the following tips:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if you ever publish anything, and it’s not data, please <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_RDF\">annotate</a> it for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">generations to come</a>. The web is too noisy to scrape anything anymore, and we’re too busy to build a spider to make sense of your mash of markup.</li>\n<li>there are <a href=\"http://answers.semanticweb.com/\">places</a> where you can ask questions if you get stuck.</li>\n<li>don’t silo your data or think it belongs to you especially if your users created it (here’s looking at you, Facebook). <a href=\"http://vibrantdata.org/\">It should be free.</a></li>\n<li>don’t break the web by creating user profiles and not annotating it with <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\">hCard</a> at the very least. There’s also <a href=\"http://www.foaf-project.org/\">FOAF</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML_Friends_Network\">XFN</a>.</li>\n<li>don’t expect silver bullets. Smart people are doing good things to take this movement forward, like <a href=\"http://www.opencalais.com/\">http://www.opencalais.com/</a> (even though OC are too focused on companies/mergers news)</li>\n<li>there are too many standards for me to consume right now. <a href=\"http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/\">Process can scare the most optimistic of us away</a>, but it seemed the folks at W3C managed to pull something wonderful together.

However, not everyone owns a smartphone. Luckily, [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/) brings voice and messaging to web and mobile applications which mean that Pollarize now allows our brick-lugging friends to compose polls via SMS.\n\n# How we built it\n\nThe usual Pollarize system constraints are the following:\n\n* poll question can not exceed 100 characters\n* options A and B can not exceed 100 characters each\n\nThe requirements are the following:\n\n* a poll SMS should be in the format “Question text. A. First option B. Second option”\n* if either A or B is omitted, then default to “Yes” and “No” respectively\n* a poll SMS can exceed the 160 character limit, but not exceed 308 characters if we take into account the delimiters ” A. ” and ” B. “\n\nThe above meant that an entire poll could at least be described at least by one SMS, and at most by two since 308 is less than 2 * 160, or two SMS fragments.\n\n# SMS\n\nTwilio seemingly don’t maintain any state on their side, i.e. if a user sends a long SMS, Twilio will not bundle the resulting SMS fragments up and send it to us in one piece. Instead, Twilio will send us the pieces one after the other as they become available from the mobile network.\n\nTo [illustrate](https://gist.github.com/opyate/3854971) this, here are the `application/form-url-encoded` payloads represented as Scala maps:\n\n<pre>\nMap(\n ToCountry -> List(GB),\n ToState -> List(London),\n SmsMessageSid -> List(SMc508bc45e41be7ec3827ac6b9617fb62),\n ToCity -> List(),\n FromZip -> List(),\n SmsSid -> List(SMc508bc45e41be7ec3827ac6b9617fb62),\n FromState -> List(),\n SmsStatus -> List(received),\n FromCity -> List(),\n Body -> List(I don't have an iPhone, so I thought I'd build SMS functionality.

Since Twilio doesn’t tell us there’s a second fragment coming, we don’t create a poll immediately after an SMS is received. Instead, we dump the payloads into MongoDB as they are received. A background worker then scans all “unprocessed” SMSes and check if there were other SMSes *from the same phone number within the last 10 seconds*. Once we have all the SMSes, we combine the original SMS text into a single text, create the poll, and we mark the Mongo record as “processed”.\n\nThe “*within the last 10 seconds*” bit only came after I discovered a massive bug. Let me explain…\n\n# The Poll-from-SMS scheduled job\n\nThe background job server re-assembles the SMS fragments into a single SMS and checks if they’re poll-worthy.\n\nThe first version of the SMSWorker accidentally did the following (using the data from the two Gists above):\n\n## Poll #1\n\n<pre>\nQuestion: I don't have an iPhone, so I thought I'd build SMS functionality.\nOption A. Great, what about something that interprets smoke signals?\nOption B. Good, now get on with\n</pre>\n\n## Poll #2\n\n<pre>\nQuestion: the Android app already!\nOption A: Yes\nOption B: No\n</pre>\n\nSee what I did there? Option B got cut off due to the 160 character SMS limit, and we accidentally created a whole new, unintelligible poll. Not quite what I had in mind, as you can imagine. I had to start making some assumptions about the way Twilio and the mobile networks interact in light of the absence of an SLA from either.\n\nI assumed a maximum of 10 seconds between SMS fragments. A counterpoint to this is that we presume a user won’t create polls via SMS in quick succession.\n\n# The Poll-from-SMS scheduled job V2\n\nYou can see a second version of the SMSWorker below.\n\n<pre>\nclass ScheduledPollFromSMSActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {\n  def receive = {\n    case \"check\" => {\n      // find all \"unprocessed\" SMSes\n      val twilios = TwilioMongo.findAllUnprocessed()\n\n      // we don't assume that users will send short SMSes in a short amount of time\n      twilios.groupBy(t => t.smsdata(\"From\")).map {\n        case (mobile, data) => {\n          // take the user's SMSes where they're 10 seconds from one another\n          val first = data.head\n          val inProximity = data.takeWhile(d => scala.math.abs(d.created - first.created) < 10000L)\n\n          // assemble the entire SMS\n          val entireSMS = inProximity.foldLeft(\"\")((a, v) => {\n            a + v.smsdata(\"Body\")\n          })\n\n          val parsed = SMSParser(entireSMS)\n          \n          // <omitted> create poll, notify user, broadcast to other listeners...\n          \n          // mark as processed, or failed\n          inProximity.map(twilioData => {\n            TwilioMongo.update(twilioData.copy(status = parsed.map(_ => \"processed\").getOrElse(\"failed\")))\n          })\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n\nThe value inProximity are the SMS fragments within a 10 second period. The SMS fragments belong to the same user, as obtained via the `groupBy` call.\n\nThe SMSParser is nothing special, but from the [test cases](https://gist.github.com/opyate/3854971#SMSParserSpec.scala) you’ll see that we’re catering for every eventuality.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nPolling via SMS was a fun little addition. Next up is voting via SMS.\n\nMongoDB allowed me to store the entire SMS payload and worry about the contents later. I didn’t create a model for the SMS payload because it isn’t core to my domain. Also, the 10-second window seemed like a safe trade-off in light of being in the dark (huh?) with regards to mobile network SLAs. We’ll measure and adjust accordingly, of course.\n\nTwilio was easy to integrate with, and it all just works.

The Thursday night before that weekend, I thought about the various tech I knew and wanted to have a good idea how to kickstart our hack before putting pen to paper on the Friday night.\n\nThe decision was made: Pollarize was going to be a Spring MVC web app running on an Amazon EC2 instance. I was going to worry about the database later, and maybe get away with using an in-memory map or something for the data.\n\n![too much too soon](/content/images/2016/11/too-much-too-soon.png)\n\nCome Friday night, I felt a bit different. Why not learn something new, I thought. Besides, AWS might be a bit clunky for a weekend hack. And I’ve heard good things about the Play! Framework and the v2 was released just a few months before.\n\n# Today\n\nFast forward seven months, over 200 deploys, and over 1,000 commits. This is what our API looks like now:\n\n![pollarize architecture](/content/images/2016/11/pollarize-architecture.png)\n\n## Core\n\nThe core app is a lightweight [Play! 2.0 (Scala edition)](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.1/Home) web app which exposes a JSON web API, and it makes transactional writes to our operational [Postgres](https://postgres.heroku.com/) database. Most other (unimportant) write operations happen via fire-and-forget calls to other modules via [Akka](http://akka.io/). The IDs for these data are pre-chosen so that subsequent calls will be idempotent.\n\n## MongoDB\n\nWrites to the operational database is fired off to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongolab.com/home) actor, which serves as the read-only cache for API reads. The data in MongoDB is already in the format the caller will consume, so it is extremely quick. The cache can be rebuilt asynchronously with the click of a button.\n\n## Media\n\nThe media module accepts profile pictures and poll images. We use [Blitline](http://blitline.com/) to get them into our signature circular format (and different sizes), and then we store the results in [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). It is exposed to the world via [Cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). If you have any image processing to be done, definitely give Blitline a shot: they’re very helpful, and the API is a lot of fun to explore.\n\n## Notify\n\nNotifications are triggered via an Akka scheduled job in the case of poll expiry and via events in the event of registration, password reset, poll creation from people you follow and follow notifications (yes, we’re a minuscule social network). In general, we use email via [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/)’s simple API, [Pubnub](http://www.pubnub.com/) for web users and [Urban Airship](http://urbanairship.com/) for our mobile users.\n\n## Other\n\nWe played with some other tech, but those were discarded for various reasons. We initially used [Redis](http://redistogo.com/) for our social network, but in our case, it was just another piece of your architecture to monitor. Our social network now happily lives in our operational database where it belongs. One day, if Postgres buckles under the graph, we’ll reconsider. Then there’s [RabbitMQ](http://www.cloudamqp.com/). It’s beautifully stable and has a sterling monitoring plugin, but once again: it’s one more thing to manage, and besides, Akka mailboxes will suffice for now.\n\n==You bet your PaaS we’re using Heroku==\n\nHeroku was perfect for getting started. Have an idea? Code it, commit, push, et voilà. No worrying about builds, deploys or anything like that: one less operational hassle to worry about when you’re building features. However, we do have a chunky $5,000 AWS credit. I’m slowly but surely creating [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) manifests for all our components and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) has been ideal for testing this locally. Aforementioned is still a nice-to-have for the size of our user base, so I’m just hacking at this in the in-between moments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, there you have it. Our architecture at a glance. There will be some more detail later down the line. In fact, I’m already drafting a Play! best practices, jotting down everything I’m learning along the way. Questions and comments on the back of a postcard.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><em>X-posted from the now-defunct pollarize.me blog</em></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"genesis\">Genesis</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"/tag/pollarize/\">Pollarize</a> was <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/03/26/the-winner-of-startup-weekend-london-is-pollarize-me/\">bourne</a> out of a 54-hour hacking stint at Startup Weekend in March 2012.

I’d spoken to people that had attended similar events before so I knew that the key to doing well was forming a small, manageable, team and executing as quickly as possible. With Juan on board and taking care of the back end we set out to fill the gaps in our team as quickly as possible and recruited [Michael Hobson](http://tremulantdesign.com/) to look after design and [Sara Gozalo](https://twitter.com/sara_sgm) to focus on front-end development.\n>\n> We learnt a lot over the course of that weekend - I got further with a startup in those 54 hours than I had in a year of trying - but most importantly we went on to win.  Winning that event had two major outcomes:\n>\n>\n> * It was a great validation of the project and encouraged us to continue with it after the event.\n> * It introduced us to the team behind Wayra UK - the weekend’s primary sponsors.\n>\n> In light of this we decided to continue the project after we left Startup Weekend and also began the process of applying to accelerators.  \n>\n> Unfortunately we had to part ways with Sara at this point due to her other commitments and Juan quickly brought [Philip Cole](https://twitter.com/philip_cole) on board to take over front end development work.\n>\n> A month or so later we made it through the final stage of selection at Wayra and became one of the first 16 teams to participate in Wayra UK.\n>\n> A month after that we moved into the Wayra Academy as one of, if not the, earliest stage teams in the program and set about starting again from scratch.\n>\n> It’s been eight months since the Startup Weekend pitch that kicked all of this off, and we’re still to break the ‘heads-down and execute like hell’ initiative that brought us that initial success. We have a wait list of 1,500 potential users signed up already, the second version of our iOS app in the app store and a brand new web app experience.  It’s very early days for us, but you can be sure that we’re giving it our best shot.  \n>\n> I’d like to take this quick opportunity to thank my team, our early adopters and all the people that have supported us behind the scenes - *Pollarize* may have been born out of an iPad purchase, but it’s growing into something bigger thanks to the awesome group of people involved in the project.\n>\n> Cheers,\n>\n> Mat\n\n## Wayra Academy\n\n![W is for Wayra](/content/images/2016/12/wayra.jpg)\n\nMat's post above already alluded to Wayra Academy. I'll fill in some more blanks.\n\nWayra was the hardest I've ever worked in my life. Apart from having to keep my day job (the guys didn't &mdash; bless 'em), I squeezed *pollarize* deliverables into every spare minute I had. As can be read from my [old *pollarize* posts](/tag/pollarize/), I used a few technologies which enabled me to iterate very, very quickly. I worked 3 hours before work in the morning, one hour over lunch, then another few hours in the evening. Weekends were 2 ten hour days. Needless to say, I never burned out. I followed a healthy diet and went to the gym every morning to stay limber. I did regret not spending the weekdays in the shiny new office with the guys, but with the help of good old email, Pivotal Tracker, and some Basecamp, I did a mighty good job of getting those tickets out and keeping the bugs at bay.\n\nI rushed through hours and hours of Scala and used some Python for some add-on NLP and recommendation projects which we never launched. Mike designed everything we threw at him perfectly, while also juggling what was to become his [tech events](http://www.3-beards.com/) business. Phil became my personal hero when he learned, developed and launched a gorgeous iOS app in 3 months. And Mat kept hustling all the way through it all, meeting, greeting, wining, dining and trying to secure us some funding.\n\nWe were going for the Big Bang, one-in-a-million, \"get lucky\" exit &mdash; something one is especially hungry for when your app is social and free.\n\n==Guy Kawasaki [warned against doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSlwuafyUUo) six years prior, but we played deaf.==\n\n## Dublin Web Summit\n\n!['Stout' in Afrikaans means 'Naughty'](/content/images/2016/11/team-web-summit.jpg)\n\nMike won 2 Web Summit tickets, and Wayra sponsored another 2, so we were all able to attend. We implemented and refined about double the number of features from the previous 6 months at the Web Summit weekend.\n\nWe had a successful iPhone app launch, got some good PR going, and met with more angels and investors you can shake an executive summary at.\n\n![App Store, here we come!](/content/images/2016/11/app-store-submission-for-approval.jpg)\n\n[(link)](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pollarize/id564203002).\n\nWe spoke, we demoed, we networked with other startups and got the buzz going. This was the best times of our respective professional lives.\n\n## Big Bang\n\nBig bang? No: crash and burn. We failed to secure funding. We pivoted, then re-pivoted in a panic to make ourselves matter. We desperately wanted to stick together as a team and make more stuff. We do sometimes wonder if we were in a different startup environment if things would have panned out differently. Besides, we weren't the only ones making opinion apps: there are [Amen](https://getamen.com/classic), [Thumb](http://thumb.it/), [Polar](http://polarb.com/) and others.\n\nWe started an agency called [Strange](http://meetstrange.com/), heavily inspired by [BERG](http://berglondon.com/). All of us, however, went on to separate things, because bills needed paying, and our respective better halves couldn't sustain us too much longer. (My story is slightly different. Having kept my day job, the missus really needed some help with the [renovations](/tag/pits-to-palace/) already!)\n\n## Exodus\n\nA couple of days ago I put a stop to all our bills: Github, Pivotal, Heroku Postgres, SSL, Mongo, etc etc. The free instance on Heroku is in maintenance mode, and our splash page will remain until the domain expires, and we probably won't renew it. The demise of *pollarize* is sad for the four of us considering the hours we put in.\n\nWe are doing great, though. Phil went on to work (and take equity in) one of the Wayra shining stars: [Night Zookeeper](http://www.nightzookeeper.com/). Mike, as I said, is crafting the best tech events, now worldwide. (Silicon Drinkabout Copenhagen, anyone?). Mat continues to conquer the world, [one idea at a time](https://medium.com/@Wehtam). The missus and I just had a baby, and I'm planning my next move.\n\nNow, I just have to wait for the guys to become slightly more available again so we can hack up our Next Big Thing. We did everything perfectly before, but the world just wasn't ready. Our next product will be perfect again, but it won't be free ;-)\n\nThanks for reading.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><a href=\"/tag/pollarize/\">Pollarize</a> is a decision-making platform that makes it quicker and easier for you to query your friends across multiple social networks and gather their responses into one concise answer.

Winning that event had two major outcomes:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>It was a great validation of the project and encouraged us to continue with it after the event.</li>\n  <li>It introduced us to the team behind Wayra UK - the weekend’s primary sponsors.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>In light of this we decided to continue the project after we left Startup Weekend and also began the process of applying to accelerators.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Unfortunately we had to part ways with Sara at this point due to her other commitments and Juan quickly brought <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philip_cole\">Philip Cole</a> on board to take over front end development work.</p>\n  \n  <p>A month or so later we made it through the final stage of selection at Wayra and became one of the first 16 teams to participate in Wayra UK.</p>\n  \n  <p>A month after that we moved into the Wayra Academy as one of, if not the, earliest stage teams in the program and set about starting again from scratch.</p>\n  \n  <p>It’s been eight months since the Startup Weekend pitch that kicked all of this off, and we’re still to break the ‘heads-down and execute like hell’ initiative that brought us that initial success. We have a wait list of 1,500 potential users signed up already, the second version of our iOS app in the app store and a brand new web app experience.  It’s very early days for us, but you can be sure that we’re giving it our best shot.  </p>\n  \n  <p>I’d like to take this quick opportunity to thank my team, our early adopters and all the people that have supported us behind the scenes - <em>Pollarize</em> may have been born out of an iPad purchase, but it’s growing into something bigger thanks to the awesome group of people involved in the project.</p>\n  \n  <p>Cheers,</p>\n  \n  <p>Mat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"wayraacademy\">Wayra Academy</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/wayra.jpg\" alt=\"W is for Wayra\" /></p>\n\n<p>Mat's post above already alluded to Wayra Academy. I'll fill in some more blanks.</p>\n\n<p>Wayra was the hardest I've ever worked in my life. Apart from having to keep my day job (the guys didn't &mdash; bless 'em), I squeezed <em>pollarize</em> deliverables into every spare minute I had. As can be read from my <a href=\"/tag/pollarize/\">old <em>pollarize</em> posts</a>, I used a few technologies which enabled me to iterate very, very quickly. I worked 3 hours before work in the morning, one hour over lunch, then another few hours in the evening. Weekends were 2 ten hour days. Needless to say, I never burned out. I followed a healthy diet and went to the gym every morning to stay limber. I did regret not spending the weekdays in the shiny new office with the guys, but with the help of good old email, Pivotal Tracker, and some Basecamp, I did a mighty good job of getting those tickets out and keeping the bugs at bay.</p>\n\n<p>I rushed through hours and hours of Scala and used some Python for some add-on NLP and recommendation projects which we never launched. Mike designed everything we threw at him perfectly, while also juggling what was to become his <a href=\"http://www.3-beards.com/\">tech events</a> business. Phil became my personal hero when he learned, developed and launched a gorgeous iOS app in 3 months. And Mat kept hustling all the way through it all, meeting, greeting, wining, dining and trying to secure us some funding.</p>\n\n<p>We were going for the Big Bang, one-in-a-million, \"get lucky\" exit &mdash; something one is especially hungry for when your app is social and free.</p>\n\n<p><mark>Guy Kawasaki <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSlwuafyUUo\">warned against doing this</a> six years prior, but we played deaf.</mark></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dublinwebsummit\">Dublin Web Summit</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/11/team-web-summit.jpg\" alt=\"'Stout' in Afrikaans means 'Naughty'\" /></p>\n\n<p>Mike won 2 Web Summit tickets, and Wayra sponsored another 2, so we were all able to attend. We implemented and refined about double the number of features from the previous 6 months at the Web Summit weekend.</p>\n\n<p>We had a successful iPhone app launch, got some good PR going, and met with more angels and investors you can shake an executive summary at.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/11/app-store-submission-for-approval.jpg\" alt=\"App Store, here we come!\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pollarize/id564203002\">(link)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We spoke, we demoed, we networked with other startups and got the buzz going. This was the best times of our respective professional lives.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bigbang\">Big Bang</h2>\n\n<p>Big bang? No: crash and burn. We failed to secure funding. We pivoted, then re-pivoted in a panic to make ourselves matter. We desperately wanted to stick together as a team and make more stuff. We do sometimes wonder if we were in a different startup environment if things would have panned out differently. Besides, we weren't the only ones making opinion apps: there are <a href=\"https://getamen.com/classic\">Amen</a>, <a href=\"http://thumb.it/\">Thumb</a>, <a href=\"http://polarb.com/\">Polar</a> and others.</p>\n\n<p>We started an agency called <a href=\"http://meetstrange.com/\">Strange</a>, heavily inspired by <a href=\"http://berglondon.com/\">BERG</a>. All of us, however, went on to separate things, because bills needed paying, and our respective better halves couldn't sustain us too much longer. (My story is slightly different. Having kept my day job, the missus really needed some help with the <a href=\"/tag/pits-to-palace/\">renovations</a> already!)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"exodus\">Exodus</h2>\n\n<p>A couple of days ago I put a stop to all our bills: Github, Pivotal, Heroku Postgres, SSL, Mongo, etc etc. The free instance on Heroku is in maintenance mode, and our splash page will remain until the domain expires, and we probably won't renew it. The demise of <em>pollarize</em> is sad for the four of us considering the hours we put in.</p>\n\n<p>We are doing great, though. Phil went on to work (and take equity in) one of the Wayra shining stars: <a href=\"http://www.nightzookeeper.com/\">Night Zookeeper</a>. Mike, as I said, is crafting the best tech events, now worldwide. (Silicon Drinkabout Copenhagen, anyone?). Mat continues to conquer the world, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Wehtam\">one idea at a time</a>. The missus and I just had a baby, and I'm planning my next move.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I just have to wait for the guys to become slightly more available again so we can hack up our Next Big Thing. We did everything perfectly before, but the world just wasn't ready. Our next product will be perfect again, but it won't be free ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>","amp":null,"image":"/content/images/2016/11/failure.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-11-15T15:25:57.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-12-02T14:09:33.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2013-07-19T14:25:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":2557,"uuid":"6a99ee2f-569b-428a-8636-07314502c638","title":"Dell XPS 13 Linux Edition makes me happy","slug":"dell-xps-13-linux-edition-makes-me-happy","markdown":"7/10\n\nThis is my review of the Dell XPS 13 Linux Edition.\n\n*TL;DR* If you're a laptop-toting \\*nix user, then this is the laptop for you. Also, upgrade the kernel before you do anything else, for the best experience.\n\nThis advice is highly unqualified, though. The last time I ran \\*nix on a laptop was when I ran some flavour of Gentoo on an old Centrino-loaded HP in 2005. I've been a Mac user ever since those darned iPhones came out.\n\nI ran out of space on my 128GB SSD Air for the umpteenth time, and shuddered at the thought of breaking off glued-down components according to some [iFixit guide](http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Mid+2013+Solid-State+Drive+Replacement/151810). (Damn! I just looked again, and there's no glue involved in upgrading the SSD. Oh, well &mdash; the missus needed a new laptop in any case, and this was a welcome hand-me-down. Also &mdash; new toys!)\n\n# First thing's first\n\nWhen you do get one of these bad boys, the first thing I recommend you do is [this](https://gist.github.com/opyate/7276520):\n\n<pre>\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends \\\n    linux-generic-lts-quantal \\\n    xserver-xorg-lts-quantal \\\n    libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-quantal\n</pre>\n\nThat will get you the latest kernel without upgrading *everything*. As any Linux user would know, upgrading to fix one problem introduces a thousand other problems, and this felt like a nice trade-off.\n\nThe reason for the above command is that I did have some wifi stability issues to start with, so I hope to save you those initial dropped connections.\n\n_Once again, kudos to [popey](http://popey.com/) over on the #ubuntu-uk IRC channel for the [advice](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack)._\n\n![popey has been a great help](/content/images/2016/11/popey.png)\n\nWifi has been stable and pretty quick.

I'll re-iterate the key components: Intel® Core™ i7-3537U CPU @ 2.00GHz × 4, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD of which 230-odd usable and a mega bright 13.3\" screen. All this on a lovely little laptop that feels like an 11\" one. I never put the brightness above a third of the available level, and at 1920 x 1080 it looks great.\n\nThe keyboard still sports a Windows button, but it's the new Windows logo which I'm not familiar with yet, and I pass it off in my mind as a generic \"dashboard\" type button, so it's all good. A [Tux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux) button would probably be a bit weird. I mean, what would a penguin button do? Summon a troop of penguins? Nah.

Just the addition of Steam of a \\*nix system feels like we've come full circle.\n\n# Qualms\n\nIt's early days &mdash; a lot might still happen. In fact, Murphy's Law states that I'll publish this favourable review and it will shortly be followed by the i7 going up in smoke.\n\nHere are some of my initial qualms:\n\n - The mouse is sometimes triggered while typing. This is configurable, and I have switched it to disable the mouse while typing, but to no avail. (**UPDATE** The long-term solution is to turn off the trackpad altogether and use a separate Bluetooth mouse)\n - The password box looses focus more times than not, and you end up typing your password in unfavourable places. This could be related to the previous issue discussed.\n - The keyboard is ever so slightly flimsy because sometimes letters will double up. Perhaps this is just a keyboard I need to get used to. Besides, I've used the Mac chiclet-style keyboards exclusively since 2009.\n - The palm rests &mdash; even though they feel great to the touch &mdash; seems to get a bit streaky after a while. My fingers are always greasy from snacking on ginger biscuits and stuff like that, and it doesn't wipe down well.\n - The backspace button does make a slight squeaky sound sometimes, but this could be because my pinky finger \"pulls\" on the button due to the angle I attack it with. Still &mdash; I don't think this should happen.\n\n# Outro\n\nIf anything else pops up, or if the XPS 13 makes my life significantly better in any other way, I'll come back here to amend.\n\nThis is my first ever piece of Dell equipment, and it doesn't look nor feel like a grey, impersonal piece of office equipment.

My go-to language since 2009. I can't add much for 2013 apart from that I'm happy to see the community mature around it. We've gone from \"How we adopted Scala at company X\" to \"How to go back in time using Akka, Play! and XYZ\". Oh, and then the [reactive course](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) was fun too, and highlighted a few holes in my Akka education.\n\n## Java\n\nJava still mostly pays the bills, and I'm writing even better Java thanks to Scala. My editor is told to highlight everything in a shade of gray, apart from re-assignables which are red. It all just flows.\n\n## Python\n\nI'm a big fan of [Pylons](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) and have used Python since 2006-ish for tiny web apps. This year sees me going down the finance route with [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) thanks to a [handful](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis) [of](https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata) [courses](https://www.coursera.org/course/compinvesting1) I did recently.\n\n## R\n\nStrangely addictive. I did a [data analysis course](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis) with the famed Johns Hopkins University earlier this year and thought I would be \"learning\" R along the way. If anything, it felt like I already knew R, and the thing that I learned was making a thorough analysis, writing it correctly and succinctly, and performing an honest peer review. R is perfect for slicing and dicing your data, and it doesn't get in the way.\n\n## Dart\n\nThe main attraction to Dart for me was the promise of compiling to a better Javascript which you can ever hope to write by hand. The Dart syntax itself is familiar. You get the odd goodies like the [cascade operator](http://news.dartlang.org/2012/02/method-cascades-in-dart-posted-by-gilad.html) (borrowed from Smalltalk) which lets you chain methods without having to return the instance in your API. Being a Scala guy, I love having rockets (`=>`) scattered all over my code (Dart's syntactic sugar for concise getters).\n\n## Javascript\n\nBeing a backend programmer by trade, I usually don't go for frontend gigs, but a client this year said they don't mind me learning on the job, and I've heard good things about AngularJS, so I dove right in. I've touched on Javascript a lot in the past, but this year I spent a significant tenth of my professional time fiddling with it.\n\n## Haskell\n\nYes, I did spend the tiniest amount of time with Haskell, but enough to mention it here. I downloaded, chopped and changed the XMonad code, and the takeaway for me was that 2014 would see more Haskell.\n\n## Other languages, not-so-much-languages, and tools\n\nMy starter Dart project is a game (where do I find the time?), hence WebGL and subsequently [GLSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language). I'm particularly excited about getting my hands even dirtier with shaders with Mozilla [recently announcing](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/11/live-editing-webgl-shaders-with-firefox-developer-tools/) live-editing of shaders using Firefox.\n\nI've always used Capistrano and Chef for my provisioning and configuration needs, but this year I gave Ansible a shot. I hope Ansible stays the way it is: small, simple, elegant. No agents - just SSH.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n2013 was a bumpy ride. We had a beautiful daughter in June, and I quit my job soon after to freelance from home and be two flights of stairs away from her. To be able to learn a few new skills and do four courses, I had to make some changes. There are the 5 AM starts, the [highly-condensed exercise routine in the morning](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout), diligently deleting anything which doesn't contribute to the plan I have for our life (this includes articles, emails, etc), and just generally getting things done.\n\nThe game I mentioned seems like a distraction, but I feel it's important that I do it. I've been in love with doodling since I was a kid and took it up this year. I'm an able musician, and since I can code, I thought I'd bring these ingredients together and make something nice. (Those umpteen characters and storylines in my head will finally be unleashed!).\n\nThanks for reading this far. May you have a great 2014.\n\n*I leave you with a doodle I made a few days ago entitled \"The Polar Bear who might have eaten Xmas\".

I did a <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis\">data analysis course</a> with the famed Johns Hopkins University earlier this year and thought I would be \"learning\" R along the way. If anything, it felt like I already knew R, and the thing that I learned was making a thorough analysis, writing it correctly and succinctly, and performing an honest peer review. R is perfect for slicing and dicing your data, and it doesn't get in the way.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dart\">Dart</h2>\n\n<p>The main attraction to Dart for me was the promise of compiling to a better Javascript which you can ever hope to write by hand. The Dart syntax itself is familiar. You get the odd goodies like the <a href=\"http://news.dartlang.org/2012/02/method-cascades-in-dart-posted-by-gilad.html\">cascade operator</a> (borrowed from Smalltalk) which lets you chain methods without having to return the instance in your API. Being a Scala guy, I love having rockets (<code>=&gt;</code>) scattered all over my code (Dart's syntactic sugar for concise getters).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"javascript\">Javascript</h2>\n\n<p>Being a backend programmer by trade, I usually don't go for frontend gigs, but a client this year said they don't mind me learning on the job, and I've heard good things about AngularJS, so I dove right in. I've touched on Javascript a lot in the past, but this year I spent a significant tenth of my professional time fiddling with it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"haskell\">Haskell</h2>\n\n<p>Yes, I did spend the tiniest amount of time with Haskell, but enough to mention it here. I downloaded, chopped and changed the XMonad code, and the takeaway for me was that 2014 would see more Haskell.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"otherlanguagesnotsomuchlanguagesandtools\">Other languages, not-so-much-languages, and tools</h2>\n\n<p>My starter Dart project is a game (where do I find the time?), hence WebGL and subsequently <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language\">GLSL</a>. I'm particularly excited about getting my hands even dirtier with shaders with Mozilla <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/11/live-editing-webgl-shaders-with-firefox-developer-tools/\">recently announcing</a> live-editing of shaders using Firefox.</p>\n\n<p>I've always used Capistrano and Chef for my provisioning and configuration needs, but this year I gave Ansible a shot. I hope Ansible stays the way it is: small, simple, elegant. No agents - just SSH.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>2013 was a bumpy ride. We had a beautiful daughter in June, and I quit my job soon after to freelance from home and be two flights of stairs away from her. To be able to learn a few new skills and do four courses, I had to make some changes. There are the 5 AM starts, the <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout\">highly-condensed exercise routine in the morning</a>, diligently deleting anything which doesn't contribute to the plan I have for our life (this includes articles, emails, etc), and just generally getting things done.</p>\n\n<p>The game I mentioned seems like a distraction, but I feel it's important that I do it. I've been in love with doodling since I was a kid and took it up this year. I'm an able musician, and since I can code, I thought I'd bring these ingredients together and make something nice. (Those umpteen characters and storylines in my head will finally be unleashed!).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this far. May you have a great 2014.</p>\n\n<p><em>I leave you with a doodle I made a few days ago entitled \"The Polar Bear who might have eaten Xmas\".

The crucial differentiator here is HTTP VS HTTPS: if you access a site directly via HTTPS, the attacker will see unintelligible garbage. ==This is A Good Thing.== If you access a site via HTTP, the attacker sees everything in the clear. Even if the website subsequently redirects to HTTPS, there's an opportunity here for the attacker to spoof a TLS certificate.\n\nSince the attacker now has a clear stream of data to intercept, the attacker can also change what your web browser sees (not you, necessarily).\n \n## Example of a DIY MITM attack\n\n I'll explore one example of exploiting an IFRAME (secure or not!) from an insecure container page. I'll take some shortcuts in the sense that I won't set up a compromised Wifi access point, or run software which injects malicious code into intercepted web traffic.\n\nClone [this gist](https://gist.github.com/opyate/5dd65f5529d9508cf78e), or follow these steps:\n\nCreate this simple index file:\n\n    <p>IFRAME below</p>\n    <iframe id=\"frame1\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/i-dont-matter.html\"></iframe>\n\n\nCreate this simple form which will be loaded by the IFRAME:\n\n    <form action=\"https://httpbin.org/post\" method=\"POST\">\n        <input name=\"secret\" placeholder=\"Secret stuff here\">\n        <input type=\"submit\">\n    </form>\n\nHost the code locally with Python:\n\n    python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nGo to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser, and submit the form. [HTTPBin](http://httpbin.org/) will echo back the payload.\n\nNow, reload the page, but open your browser's dev tools, and paste the code from the hack into the JavaScript console:\n\n\n    var contents = '<form action=\"https://httpbin.org/post\" method=\"POST\">';\n    contents += '<input name=\"secret\" placeholder=\"Secret stuff here\">';\n    contents += '<input type=\"submit\" onclick=\"return hack()\">';\n    contents += '<script type=\"text/javascript\">';\n    contents += 'function hack() { alert(\"h4x0rz\"); }';\n    contents += '</script>';\n    contents += '</form>';\n    document.getElementById('frame1').src = \"data:text/html;charset=utf-8,\" + escape(contents);\n\n\nThe above the MITM attack and is what the attacker could do with the \"in-the-clear data stream\" we discussed before. The attacker just matched on a known token (like the form submit button) and injected custom code with which to do evil.\n\nSubmit the form, and see the side effect.\n\nNote that the IFRAME's contents have been entirely modified. It was even made to look like the original content. ==The fact that the IFRAME's `src` attribute previously loaded a secure site DOES NOT MATTER.==\n\nConsider yourself alerted.\n\n## What evil side effects are there?\n\nOK, so the JavaScript `alert` you just saw is just for show, but consider this:\n\n* the attacker sends the sensitive data you just submitted off to their domain to be harvested à la [Tunisia](http://www.fastcompany.com/1715575/tunisian-government-allegedly-hacking-facebook-gmail-accounts-dissidents-and-journalists)\n* the attacker changes the delivery address for the expensive item you just bought to the unused address down their street\n\n## Who cares about my site?\n\nYour insecure site mightn't accept sensitive input like payment details or sell valuable items, but your vulnerable site might be frequented by someone who does.\n\nAn attacker might know that a high profile (read: hack-worthy) individual called Bob Millionaire frequents your insecure pet discussion website. Let's imagine for a second your forum software requires a login. **Your insecure website has now become a target.**\n\nThe attacker will now trivially sniff for Bob Millionaire's password on your insecure website, which she can replay against other more lucrative websites if we can [presume that Bob Millionaire re-uses his passwords](http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2013/uk-adults-taking-online-password-security-risks/).\n\nEven if you're just the third party who owns the domain the IFRAME loads, you have to **strongly consider if you want to be associated with the bad press which comes with your client's website being exploited** and having the IFRAME which was destined for your content being on the receiving end.\n\n## The solution\n\nCan we get to a better place by mandating all container sites to enforce TLS? I think we can. But this will just be a better place, not the ultimate secure place.\n\nThere's a sliding scale, you see.\n\nOn the paranoid end, you can presume every device and every network is compromised. No amount of TLS will help you. You can trust your laptop as much as you do the web browser running on the old XP PC down the Internet cafe: you'll think twice about what you do online, and where you do it. (yes, a modified version of any web browser can show a green padlock for anything)\n\nOn the naive end, you can presume that you live in a free country, with devices built in secured facilities by known brands, and that the websites you frequent are hosted in secure data centres, managed by security veterans who can be trusted.\n\nChoose your position on the scale, and accept the risk that's forthcoming.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>In this post, I consider the information security implications around using a secure IFRAME (which, for example, hosts a payment or checkout page) on an insecure container page.</p>\n\n<p>Some definitions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a \"secure IFRAME\" is one where its <code>src</code> attribute points to a domain over HTTPS, and any forms within the IFRAME submits to an HTTPS domain</li>\n<li>an \"insecure container page\" is a \"container\" because it hosts the IFRAME (the HTML code for the page will have an <code>&lt;IFRAME&gt;</code> tag somewhere within it), and \"insecure\" because it was loaded over HTTP, not HTTPS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"opinionsinthewild\">Opinions in the wild</h2>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR Regardless of how secure the IFRAME is, the container site can be compromised and render said security moot.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Start typing \"secure iframe\" in Google, and note the suggestions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=secure+iframe+in+non+secure+page\">secure iframe in non secure page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=secure%20iframe%20on%20unsecure%20page\">secure iframe on unsecure page</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The search results point to related questions asked on the <a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/\">Information Security Stack Exchange Q&amp;A site</a>, and a few blog posts by security experts have been written on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>A non-exhaustive list of examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38317/specific-risks-of-embedding-an-https-iframe-in-an-http-page\">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38317/specific-risks-of-embedding-an-https-iframe-in-an-http-page</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/894/are-there-security-issues-with-embedding-an-https-iframe-on-an-http-page\">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/894/are-there-security-issues-with-embedding-an-https-iframe-on-an-http-page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/11/does-insecure-website-compromise.html\">http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/11/does-insecure-website-compromise.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3144986/http-and-https-iframe\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3144986/http-and-https-iframe</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"abbrtitlemaninthemiddlemitmabbrprimer\"><abbr title=\"Man In The Middle\">MITM</abbr> primer</h2>\n\n<p>MITM attack is a \"man in the middle\" attack.</p>\n\n<p>You go to your favourite coffee shop, and the following happens</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>log on to their free Wifi</li>\n<li>frequent your favourite online shopping fix</li>\n<li>your requests to see products and pay for products go through many \"hops\" before it reaches the destination</li>\n<li>your browser connects to the Wifi access point</li>\n<li>the latter connects to the coffee shop's ISP via one hop or many</li>\n<li>the ISP connects to a shared exchange somewhere in Britain via one hop or many</li>\n<li>the exchange connects to an exchange somewhere in another country via one hop or many (and almost definitely via a long undersea cable)</li>\n<li>the overseas exchange connects to the shopping site's web server in a data centre somewhere (and all together now!) via one hops or many</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any of these \"hops\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\">can be compromised</a>, but the typical scenario is for the attacker to host their version of \"free Wifi\" right from their laptop with a legitimate-sounding name like \"FreeHub\". </p>\n\n<p>At this point the attacker's laptop is just one more \"hop\" you're totally oblivious to when you connect to \"FreeHub\", letting your surfing activity through uninterrupted.</p>\n\n<p>However, since the attacker now has access to the data stream between you and the outside world, she can now see the data.

You can count on your fingers the full months in-between (October, November, December - that is 3) then roughly round up September and January to make another month - that's 4.\n\nNow say **\"I have 4 months left until my website launches\"**.\n\nBut try this: calculate the actual business days until January 11th. Cut out weekends and public holidays.\n\nNow say **\"I have 79 business days left until my website launches\"**.\n\nIt somehow feels like you have less time, doesn't it?\n\nThis, for me, is such an important number to keep in mind, that I have created a small [web app](https://github.com/opyate/daysuntil) for it to load up on your dashboards.\n\nHere's an [example](http://bizdaysuntil.herokuapp.com/?year=2015&month=12&day=25&what=Xmas&size=24&highlight=fefe55):\n\n![business days until Xmas](/content/images/2016/11/bizdaysuntil.png)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Communication at your business is key to levelling the knowledge landscape and eliminating surprises.

I discovered this repo two days after Omer made it public, and an email to-and-fro ensued, in which I suggested this and that.

Taking samples of house size (x) and their house price (y) can be plotted as a straight line using linear regression. Since the house price can never be negative, the curve ends up looking like _/\nThis simple graph is a neural network: given an input size, an output price can be predicted.\nThis graph appears frequently in NN literature, and is known as a **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit).\n\nInput house size can be expanded to many more features like ZIP code, number of bedrooms, etc - \"home features\".\n\n## Supervised learning\n\n[Video #3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/2c38r/supervised-learning-with-neural-networks) talks about Supervised Learning.\nIt discusses different applications, and which type of NN is best suited, e.g.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Input (x)</td>\n<td>Output (y)</td>\n<td>Application</td>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>Data</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Home features</td>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>Real estate</td>\n<td>Standard NN</td>\n<td>Structured (e.g. CSV)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ad, user info</td>\n<td>Click? (0/1)</td>\n<td>Online ads</td>\n<td>Standard NN</td>\n<td>Structured |\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Image</td>\n<td>Classification</td>\n<td>Photo tagging</td>\n<td>CNN</td>\n<td>Unstructured |\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audio</td>\n<td>Text transcript</td>\n<td>Speech recog</td>\n<td>RNN (because it's 1-dimensional time-series)</td>\n<td>Unstructured |\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>English</td>\n<td>Chinese</td>\n<td>Machine translation</td>\n<td>RNN (also sequence data)</td>\n<td>Unstructured |\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Image, Radar</td>\n<td>Position of other cars</td>\n<td>Autonomous driving</td>\n<td>Custom/Hybrid</td>\n<td>Unstructured |\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## Why is Deep Learning taking off?\n\n[Video #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/praGm/why-is-deep-learning-taking-off) asks why deep learning is taking off. (well, I've personally been fascinated with neural nets since the late nineties, but here we go...).\nAnswer: data is getting larger, and NNs are more performant at data scale.\nNg briefly touches on why the signoid is dropping out of favour and being replaced by ReLU: The sigmoid has a 0 gradient in the two outermost regions (the tails of the curve) which slows down training, because if you implement gradient descent, and the gradient is 0, then the parameters just change very slowly. Whereas with the ReLU, the gradient is 1 for all positive values.

Instead, Logistic regression \"clamps\" the output to **0 <= y^ <= 1** using a sigmoid function. \"y hat\", i.e. *y^* will be the prediction of *y*, the \"ground truth\".\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/logisticregression.png)\n\n\n## Logistic regression cost function\n\n[Video #3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/yWaRd/logistic-regression-cost-function) explains the cost function needed to train parameters *w* and *b*.\nSquare error doesn't work well as a loss (or error) function, because no global minimum can be obtained. It makes gradient descent not work well at all (your \"ball\" gets trapped in the first \"hole\" as it rolls down the hill). We want a function which ends us up with one convex basin, not a squiggly line (many basins).\n\nThe cost function measures how well you're doing over the entire training set. \n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/logisticregression-costfunction.png)\n\n## Gradient descent\n\n[Video #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/A0tBd/gradient-descent) discusses gradient descent as an \"optimisation algorithm\" shows how logistic regression can be used as a tiny neural net.\n\nGradient descent is your \"ball rolling to the bottom of the basin\", or final a local optimum for *w*. It shows how taking the derivative (or the slope) of the curve finds the optimum where the slope is 0 (a flat line underneath the curve). For the multi-dimensional case where we're finding *w* AND *b*, it would be the plane under the basin.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/gradient-descent.png)\n\n\nThe latter part of the video makes a brief note of calculus where you can use *d* for the derivative of a single-variable function, or *squiggly-d* as the partial derivative of a multi-variable function, or the cost function, in our case: *J(w,b)*\n\n## Derivatives\n\n[Video #5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/0ULGt/derivatives) is just a calculus refresher.\n\nDitto for [Video #6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/oEcPT/more-derivative-examples).\n\nIf you are in need of a calculus refresher, I suggest supplementing these two videos with [3blue1brown's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) or [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and also pay attention to the \"chain rule\".\n\nDuring this course, you're not expected to derive the derivatives - all the ones you need are provided, or otherwise consult the derivative lookup tables in any calculus textbook.\n\n## Computation graph\n\n[Video #6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/4WdOY/computation-graph) talks about the computation graph which explains why neural networks are organised in terms of a forward pass (for the output of the network) and a back propagation step (for the gradients or derivatives). It shows an example of working through a computation graph to compute the function J (the cost function).\n\n[Video #7](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/0VSHe/derivatives-with-a-computation-graph) goes further with more examples, like computing the derivate of *J* with respect to *v*, or *J* with respect to *a* in this graph:\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/computation-graph-derivaties-example1.png)\n\nIf *v* or *a* nudges by a little bit (0.001), then *J* nudges by 3 times as much.\n\nNg further shows that nudging *b* by 0.001 nudges *J* by 6 times as much, and *c* 9 times as much.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/computation-graph-derivaties-example2.png)\n\nI like how this video uses a decimal (0.001) change to show how *J*'s decimal changes, and all-in-all building up good \"number sense\" for derivatives and forward- and back-propagation.\n\nAlso, in Python code, the variable representing \"the derivative in terms of VAR\" would just be written in code as *dvar*, e.g. *da*.\n\n## Logistic regression gradient descent\n\n[Video #8](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/5sdh6/logistic-regression-gradient-descent) discusses the key equations needed to compute gradient descent for logistic regression. Ng uses the computation graph to illustrate again.\n\nRecap logistic regression:\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/logistic-regression-recap.png)\n\nThe example using the computation graph shows how to get the derivatives of the weights and the learning rate, with which to update the weights and learning rate:\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/logistic-regression-gradient-descent.png)\n\n## Gradient descent on m examples\n\n[Video #9](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/udiAq/gradient-descent-on-m-examples) takes the previous single example and applies it to a training set of *m* examples. (reminder that the cost function *J* is the loss function *L* over *m* examples.)\n\nNg scribbles down some pseudo-code (for two features: *dw1* and *dw2*) and makes a note about using for loops with large data sets, and how the expensiveness of it can be circumvented by vectorisation, which is discussed in the next video.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/pseudocode-gradient-descent-m-examples.png)\n\n## Vectorisation\n\n[Video #10](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/NYnog/vectorization) starts with \"vectorisation is the art of getting rid of for loops in code\".\n\nA quick Jupyter example shows the speed-up:\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/vectorisation-jupyter.png)\n\n[Video #11](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/ZPlX9/more-vectorization-examples) elaborates with more Python examples. Numpy will have element-wise functions for each of *exp*, *log*, *abs*, etc so you'll never need to loop.\n\n[Video #12](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/moUlO/vectorizing-logistic-regression) talks about vectorising logistic regression.\n\nJust a note: Activation = forward propagation = predictions, terms Ng uses interchangeably. *a* is also denoted *y^* (y hat being the prediction) sometimes.\n\n\"1 by m\" matrix is just a \"row vector\", or \"an m-dimensional row vector\".\n\nHere he shows how you can get *z1*, *z2*, ..., *zm* for m samples, where *z1 = w.transpose \\* x1 + b* using just\n\n```\nZ = np.dot(w.T, x) + b\n```\n\nAnd doing the same for *A* using some implementation of sigma.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/vectorising-logistic-regression.png)\n\n# Vectorising logistic regression's gradient computation\n\n[Video #13](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/IgFnJ/vectorizing-logistic-regressions-gradient-output) explains logistic regression for m samples using numpy.\n\nIt has `Z = np.dot(w.T, x) + b` from before, but adds \n\n\n```\nA = sigmoid(Z)\ndZ = A - Y\ndw = 1/m * X * dZ.T\ndb = 1/m * np.sum(dZ)\nw := w - sigmoid(dw)\nb := b - sigmoid(db)\n```\n\nThen he wraps it with a `range(1000)` outer loop, and I guess it will become more apparent later that these extra iterations gets your weights to a value where they \"settle\" (and you can probably break out of the loop if the delta becomes neglible).\n\n## Broadcasting in Python\n\n[Video #14](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/uBuTv/broadcasting-in-python) basically means when using Python/numpy, when working with arrays and matrices, the code will intuitively do the right thing.\n\nE.g. here you want to add 100 to the 4x1 column vector, but numpy will \"broadcast\" 100 into a 4x1 vector of 100s.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/broadcasting-example1.png)\n\nNg refers to the [numpy docs on broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html).\n\n## A note on python/numpy vectors\n\n[Video #15](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/87MUx/a-note-on-python-numpy-vectors) talks about the pitfalls of working with rank-1 arrays, and urges you to be explicit about your matrix dimensions.\n\n## Quick tour of Jupyter\n\n[Video #16](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/ChN1T/quick-tour-of-jupyter-ipython-notebooks) introduces us to Jupyter (previously known as iPython notebooks).\n\n## Explanation of logistic regression cost function (optional)\n\n[Video #17](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/SmIbQ/explanation-of-logistic-regression-cost-function-optional) quickly explains why we like to use the cost function that we do for the logistic regression. Ng recaps the formulas for binary classification, and gets to using \"maximum likelihood estimation\" from statistics to derive our cost function.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/cost-function-explanation.png)\n\nAnd that's a wrap for week 2.\n\n## Code snippets\n\nHere follows some code snippets I picked up along the way.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/opyate/e28992cbaacf6623fa04b0455d72d25d\n\n## What else I've learned\n\n\n### Clean and pre-process\n\nBefore building a neural net, you'll need to pre-process your data. (This is the same gist I picked up when doing my NN diploma back in 2001: cleaning and preparing data is sometimes the hardest part)\n\nCommon steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:\n\n* Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m\\_train, m\\_test, num\\_px, ...)\n* Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num\\_px * num\\_px * 3, 1)\n* \"Standardize\" the data, e.g. divide each pixel by 255\n\n\nThe oval \"neuron\" in this diagram computes a linearity (Wx + b) and then an activation (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU) which is the prediction.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/neural-net-one-example.png)\n\n### Key steps to building a model\n\n- define the model structure, such as number of input features\n- initialize the parameters of the model, e.g. initialise the weights *w* to zeros or ones, or random numbers, and initialise the bias *b* \n- loop\n    * forward propagation: calculate current loss; from *X* to *cost*\n    * backward propagation: calculate current gradient\n    * update parameters (weights and bias): this is gradient descent!\n\nYou have a choice of activations\n\n- sigmoid\n- tanh\n- ReLU\n\nYou have a choice of loss functions:\n\n- L1, or \"least absolute deviations\" (LAD), or \"least absolute errors\" (LAE)\n- L2, or \"least squares error\" (LSE)\n- L3? (as per week2) or \"log-likelihood\"?\n\nGood activations and loss functions seem to be \"stumbled upon\" empirically, and must be a topic of research.\n\nPicking good hyperparameters (number of iterations, and learning rate) is an art?\nDifferent learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.\n\nAn example of good/bad learning rates are illustrated below: good rate converges, and a bad rate diverges. (Images: Adam Harley)\n\n![sgd](/content/images/2017/11/sgd.gif)\n\n![sgd_bad](/content/images/2017/11/sgd_bad.gif)\n\n\nIf the learning rate is too large, the cost may oscillate up and down, or diverge completely. \nLower cost isn't necessarily better, and could lead to overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.\n\nMore techniques in later weeks to reduce overfitting.\n\nWe have just built a single-node neural network, and from the NN course I did in 2001 I remember this being called a [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron).\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h1 id=\"neuralnetworkbasics\">Neural Network Basics</h1>\n\n<p>These are my notes on week #2 of the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/\">Introduction to Deep Learning</a> Coursera MOOC.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"binaryclassification\">Binary Classification</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/Z8j0R/binary-classification\">Video #1</a> basically sets up some notation for showing how a matrix input maps to one bit of information (1 or 0, true or false, i.e. whether a picture is of a hotdog <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/news/silicon-valleys-hot-dog-identifying-app-very-real\">or not</a>).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"logisticregression\">Logistic regression</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/LoKih/logistic-regression\">Video #2</a> shows how Logistic Regression trumps Linear Regression in the sense that the latter will output values in the range negative to very large (>1), which is not what we want for binary classification.

(This is the same gist I picked up when doing my NN diploma back in 2001: cleaning and preparing data is sometimes the hardest part)</p>\n\n<p>Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)</li>\n<li>Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)</li>\n<li>\"Standardize\" the data, e.g. divide each pixel by 255</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The oval \"neuron\" in this diagram computes a linearity (Wx + b) and then an activation (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU) which is the prediction.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/neural-net-one-example.png\" alt=\"screenshot\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keystepstobuildingamodel\">Key steps to building a model</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>define the model structure, such as number of input features</li>\n<li>initialize the parameters of the model, e.g. initialise the weights <em>w</em> to zeros or ones, or random numbers, and initialise the bias <em>b</em> </li>\n<li>loop\n<ul><li>forward propagation: calculate current loss; from <em>X</em> to <em>cost</em></li>\n<li>backward propagation: calculate current gradient</li>\n<li>update parameters (weights and bias): this is gradient descent!</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You have a choice of activations</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>sigmoid</li>\n<li>tanh</li>\n<li>ReLU</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You have a choice of loss functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>L1, or \"least absolute deviations\" (LAD), or \"least absolute errors\" (LAE)</li>\n<li>L2, or \"least squares error\" (LSE)</li>\n<li>L3? (as per week2) or \"log-likelihood\"?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Good activations and loss functions seem to be \"stumbled upon\" empirically, and must be a topic of research.</p>\n\n<p>Picking good hyperparameters (number of iterations, and learning rate) is an art? <br />\nDifferent learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.</p>\n\n<p>An example of good/bad learning rates are illustrated below: good rate converges, and a bad rate diverges.

This described a 2-layer network.\n\nNote for *a[1]* the weights are *w[1]* of dimension (4,3) and the bias is *b[1]* with dimension (4,1). The output node has *w[2]* of (1,4) and *b[2]* of (1,1).\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/representation.png)\n\n## Computing a neural network's output\n\n[Video #3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/GyW9e/neural-network-representation) says that our new representation of a neural net's hidden layer contains more than one of the single-node logistic regression node we studied in week 2.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/hidden.png)\n\nAgain, the trick is to not for-loop over the 1+ new nodes, but to vectorise a solution.\n\nTo compute this 2-layer network, you need these 4 formulas:\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/4formulas.png)\n\n## Vectorising across multiple examples\n\n[Video #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/ZCcMM/vectorizing-across-multiple-examples) is like before, but vectorising across many training examples.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/vectorising-with-forloop.png)\n\nVectorising the for-loop. A[1]'s first column refers to the first training example, and the first row of the first column refers to the activation in the first hidden node. The next row refers to the activation of the first training example in the second hidden node.\n\nSimilarly, *A[1]*'s second column refers to the second training example, and the first row of the second column refers to the activation of the second training example in the first hidden node, and so forth.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/vectorising-without-forloop.png)\n\n## Explanation for vectorised implementation\n\n[Video #5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/Y20qP/explanation-for-vectorized-implementation) just adds an explanation to the previous concept.\n\n## Activation functions\n\n[Video #6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/4dDC1/activation-functions) notes that thus far in the course we've been using sigmoid activation function, but reveals alternatives. The first candidate being *tanh* or the hyperbolic tangent, which Ng notes is almost always a better choice than sigmoid (because *tanh* yields a 0 mean, and sigmoid a 0.5 mean, so *tanh* centers your data, but doesn't elaborate further)\n\nThe exception is to use the sigmoid function on an output layer which does binary classification, where you'd like a prediction between 0 and 1.\n\nThe downside to *tanh* (which is the same for sigmoid) is that the slope is zero when *z* is very large or very small and this **can slow down gradient descent**.\n\nWhich brings us to *ReLU*. The derivative is 0 when *z* is negative, and for positive *z* the slope is just very distinct from 0, so your network learns much faster, and this works well in practice.\n\nThere's also \"leaky ReLU\" which has a slight slope for negative *z*\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/actvation-function-summary.png)\n\nNg ends with a note that we're spoilt for choice when it comes to which hyperparameters, activations, loss, etc to use, and you have to \"try them all\" to see which suits your application the best. Time to get a second GPU, then.\n\n## Why do you need non-linear activation functions?\n\n[Video #7](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/OASKH/why-do-you-need-non-linear-activation-functions) asks \"why need an activation function at all?\"\n\nWe try and experiment where we just set *a* to *z*. *yhat* then just becomes a linear function of your features *x* and the model is no more expressive than just standard logistic regression. The hidden layer becomes useless, because a composition of a linear function is itself just a linear function.\n\nHowever, if your output is a real number (not a classification), e.g. like predicting a house price, then you don't want a linear activation function.\n\n## Derivatives of activation functions\n\n[Video #8](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/qcG1j/derivatives-of-activation-functions) reminds us that back-prop uses the slope of the activation functions.\n\nSigmoid slopes at high and low are 0, and the slope at z=0 is 1/4.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/sigmoid-slope.png)\n\nTanh slope is 0 at high and low, and 1 at z=0.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/tanh-slope.png)\n\nReLU has slope 0 for z<0 and 1 for z>=0.\n\nLeaky ReLU has slope 0.01 for z<0 and 1 for z>=0.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/relu-slope.png)\n\n## Gradient descent for neural networks\n\n[Video #9](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/Wh8NI/gradient-descent-for-neural-networks) is the crib sheet for the formulas for a one hidden layer neural network.\n\nA note on matrix dimensions:\nFor a network with the first layer size nx = n0, the hidden layer size n1, and the output size n2 (or 1), the dimensions will be as follows:\n\n- W1 = (n1, n0)\n- b1 = (n1, 1) (aka an n1 dimensional vector, or an n1-by-1 dimensional matrix, or column vector)\n- W2 = (n2, n1)\n- b2 = (n2, 1)\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/cribsheet-onehidden-nn.png)\n\n## Backpropagation intuition (optional)\n\n[Video #10](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/6dDj7/backpropagation-intuition-optional) explains the cribsheet from the previous video. Worth a watch.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/summary-gradient-descent.png)\n\nAnd with that Ng notes that we've just seen the most difficult part of neural networks: deriving these functions.\n\n## Random initialisation\n\n[Video #11](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/XtFPI/random-initialization) starts of with stating that initialising weights to zero for logistic regression was OK (because it's single node), but for a neural network it won't work: you end up with a symmetry problem - all nodes compute the same thing. The bias can be initialised to zero.\n\n<pre>\n# very small random values\nW1 = np.random.randn((nx,m)) * 0.01\nb1 = np.zero((nx,1))\n</pre>\n\n\nWhy small initial values? Large initial values will be on the outskirts of sigmoid or tanh, and have zero-ish slope, so the network trains very slowly (less of an issue if you don't use sigmoid or tanh).\n\n0.01 is OK for a shallow network, but next week will discuss why you might want to use smaller values (epsilon?).\n\n## What else I've learned\n\nThe model we built by hand in the previous week's' exam can be summarised in these few lines using [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/):\n\n<pre>\nclf = sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV()\nclf.fit(X.T, Y.T)\nLR_predictions = clf.predict(X.T)\n\n# plot\nplot_decision_boundary(lambda x: clf.predict(x), X, Y)\nplt.title(\"Logistic Regression\")\n</pre>\n\nLogistic regression doesn't work on a dataset that isn't linearly separable. A classification problem IS linearly separable, but we'll now encounter problems that aren't.\n\nNeural networks are able to learn even highly non-linear decision boundaries, unlike logistic regression. The techniques learnt during this week can still lead to overfitted models (when using many iterations), but in later weeks we will learn about regularisation, which lets you use very large models (such as n_h = 50) without much overfitting.\n\n\nReferences from exam:\n\nhttp://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/neural-networks/\nhttp://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h1 id=\"shallowneuralnetworks\">Shallow Neural Networks</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/qg83v/neural-networks-overview\">Video #1</a> says superscript square brackets refers to the layer, as opposed to superscript round brackets which refers to an input sample.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/overview.png\" alt=\"screenshot\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"neuralnetworkrepresentation\">Neural network representation</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/GyW9e/neural-network-representation\">Video #2</a> mentions input layer (<em>a</em> superscript square bracket zero), hidden layer (<em>a</em> superscript square bracket one, with each neuron having a subscript 1..n), output layer (<em>a</em> superscript square bracket two), and target prediction which is just equal to the last layer.

It also improves dev set performance. So, it does two things.\n\n# Setting up your goal\n\n## Single number evaluation metric\n\n[Video #3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/wIKkC/single-number-evaluation-metric) shows a single number which you can look at to help you choose a classifier to iterate on.\n\n### Example 1\n\nInstead of looking at both [Precision and Recall](https://www.kdnuggets.com/faq/precision-recall.html). (Ng mentions don't worry too much about the definitions for now, hence my own link)\n\nThe one number to look at is the F1 score. The hand-wavy way to think of it is the \"average of Precision and Recall\" says Ng. More accurately, it's the Harmonic Mean of P and R: `2 / (1/P + 1/R)`. F1 becomes your single real number evaluation metric.\n\n### Example 2\n\nYour app targets four regions, and your classifier gives different error rates for each region. A single real number metric hear could just be the average of those four numbers and then the classifier with the lowest average error is the better one.\n\nA dev set and a single real number evaluation metric will help you make better choices with your classifiers.\n\n## Satisficing and Optimising metric\n\n[Video #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/uNWnZ/satisficing-and-optimizing-metric) shows that you needn't build a hacky cost function to help you make a decision, e.g. `accuracy - 0.5 * running_time`, but instead of say something like \"I'm happy with any running time below 100ms, after which I'll choose the most accurate\".\n\nIn this case, \"running time\" is satisficing, and \"accuracy\" is optimising.\n\nYou'll have one optimising metric, and one or more satisficing metrics.\n\n![Satisficing and Optimising metric](/content/images/2017/11/optimising-satisficing.png)\n\n## Train/dev/test set distributions\n\n[Video #5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/78P8f/train-dev-test-distributions) shows the train/dev/test set distributions.\n\nDev set is aka the \"hold-out cross validation set\".\n\n**Choose a dev set and test set from the same distribution to reflect the data you expect to see in the future AND consider important to do well on.**\n\nE.g. if you're targetting US and China with your app, don't make the dev set US, and the test set China, because you'll end up with moving targets.\n\n## Size of dev and test sets\n\n[Video #6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/HOby4/size-of-the-dev-and-test-sets) shows how old-school heuristics like a 70%/30% split on train/test doesn't really make sense if you have big data. \n\nSet your test set to be big enough to give high confidence in the overall performance of your system.\n\nThe set you're tuning/iterating on is the dev set, although this was previously called test set. Which brings us to: sometimes you mighn't need a test set, just a train/dev set, because a large enough dev set means you might not overfit it too badly. Ng says he still prefers a test set in all cases.\n\n## When to change dev/test sets and metrics\n\n[Video #7](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/Ux3wB/when-to-change-dev-test-sets-and-metrics) says you might have put your target in the wrong place, so it would be a good idea to move the target, i.e. change the dev/test sets, or redefine the error metric in your code (put a very low weight on porn images so it doesn't activate a cat prediction).\n\nSo far we've discussed how to **define** a metric to evaluate classifiers, but now we'll talk about how to **do well** on this metric. Aka we've determined where to place the target, but now we'll focus on how to hit the bull's eye a bit better. That might be optmising the cost function J that your network is optimising.\n\n# Comparing to human-level performance\n\n## Why human-level performance?\n\n[Video #8](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/FWkpo/why-human-level-performance) talks about why human-level performance matters as a comparison to machine-level performance.\n\nIt talks about Bayes optimal error, the best possible error. E.g. the perfect error might not be zero if an image is just too blurry to classify. \n\nHuman tasks are still valuable if the ML is poor, e.g.\n\n- getting labelled data from humans\n- manual error analysis\n- better analysis of bias/variance (which we'll talk about later)\n\nKnowing how well humans do can help you reduce bias and variance.\n\n## Avoidable bias\n\n[Video #9](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/LG12R/avoidable-bias) shows that you can use bias reduction techniques when the human error is much lower than your training error, or variance reduction/avoidance techniques/tactics when the human error is near the training error, but the dev error is still a way off.\n\nBias reduction techniques could be training a larger network or running the training set for longer.\n\nVariance reduction techniques could be regularisation or increasing the training set. \n\nHuman error is a good proxy for Bayes error in image classification, because eyesight our stronger sense.\n\nThe difference between human/Bayes error and the training error is called the **avoidable bias**: keep improving your training performance until you reach Bayes error. (you can't go further, because Bayes error is the theoretical limit)\n\nThe difference between training error and dev error is the **variance**.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/avoidable-bias.png)\n\n## Understanding human-level performance\n\n[Video #10](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/XInVm/understanding-human-level-performance) asks how would you define \"human level error\" if you have a range of humans, e.g. when looking at an X-ray to make a diagnoses, how would Joe Bloggs VS doctor VS experienced doctor VS TEAM of experienced doctors perform and which one of those is your \"human level performance\".\n\nDepending on the context, the answer could be to go with the Bayes proxy, i.e. with the lowest error if you want to diagnose correctly. Or the context could be to have a low-level \"see a specialist\" recommender which could fare as well as a typical doctor.\n\n![screenshot](/content/images/2017/11/which-human-level.png)\n\nNg applies this \"choice\" of humans to the bias/variance decision, e.g. whichever human level you choose, if the training error is far off, focus on avoidable bias.\n\n## Surpassing human-level performance\n\n[Video #10](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/LiV7n/surpassing-human-level-performance) mentions that ML surpass humans in structured data problems which aren't perception tasks. E.g. humans do well with vision and audio, but a machine can clearly fare better at pouring over (lots of) structured data. However, ML is getting better at perception problems too now.\n\n## Improving your model performance\n\n[Video #11](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/4IPD6/improving-your-model-performance) summaries that we've now learned about\n\n- orthogonalisation\n- how to set up dev/test sets\n- human level performance as a proxy for Bayes error\n- how to estimate avoidable bias and variance\n\nThis session pulls it together into a set of guidelines:\n\n![guidelines](/content/images/2017/11/guidelines.png)\n\n\nThis week's Heroes of Deep Learning [video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/Ggkxn/andrej-karpathy-interview) features [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/).\n\nAnd that's a wrap for week 1.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<h1 id=\"introductiontomlstrategy\">Introduction to ML Strategy</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"whymlstrategy\">Why ML Strategy?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/yeHYT/why-ml-strategy\">Video #1</a> talks about the motivation: you've worked on your cat classifier model, and only achieve 90% accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>You have ideas how to improve:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>collect more data</li>\n<li>collect more diverse training set</li>\n<li>train algo longer with gradient descent</li>\n<li>try Adam instead of gradient descent</li>\n<li>try a bigger/smaller network</li>\n<li>try dropout</li>\n<li>Add L2 regularisation</li>\n<li>change the architecture\n<ul><li>activation functions</li>\n<li>hidden units</li>\n<li>etc</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You might choose poorly and waste time.</p>\n\n<p>This course will teach you strategies to point you in the direction of the more promising things to try.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"orthogonalisation\">Orthogonalisation</h2>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/FRvQe/orthogonalization\">Video #2</a> talks about orthogonalisation, which is knowing which change effects which outcome.</p>\n\n<p>An analog is an old-fashion monitor which has distinct knobs for adjusting each of the picture <br />\n- width\n- height\n- trapezoidal shape\n- x offset\n- y offset\n- brightness\n- contrast</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine you had only one knob, which - when fiddled adjusts the picture in this way:</p>\n\n<p><code>0.3 * height + 0.1 * width + 8 * brightness + 0.5 * trapezoidal ... etc</code></p>\n\n<p>This knob would be impossible to use.</p>\n\n<p>So, Orthogonalisation means that the monitor designers designed the knobs and underlying circuitry so that each knob does only one thing.</p>\n\n<p>The chain of outcomes we'd like to perform well, in order, are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>fit the training set well on cost function</li>\n<li>fit dev set well on cost function</li>\n<li>fit test set well on cost function</li>\n<li>performs well in real world</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of these steps would have different \"knobs\" you can try, e.g.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"bigger network\" or \"Adam\" for training set</li>\n<li>\"regularisation\" for dev set</li>\n<li>\"bigger dev set\" for test set</li>\n<li>\"change dev set\" or \"change cost function\" for real world</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ng notes that \"early stopping\" is less orthogonalised because it changes both how well you fit the training set, because of you stop early, you fit the training set less well.

The hand-wavy way to think of it is the \"average of Precision and Recall\" says Ng. More accurately, it's the Harmonic Mean of P and R: <code>2 / (1/P + 1/R)</code>. F1 becomes your single real number evaluation metric.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"example2\">Example 2</h3>\n\n<p>Your app targets four regions, and your classifier gives different error rates for each region.

Deep learning algorithms are quite robust against random errors, but not systematic errors, i.e. all yellow cats are mislabelled as golden retrievers.\n\nFor dev/test set, you can add another category to your error analysis called \"mislabelled\", and again: only fix mislabelling if it contributes significantly to the misclassification.\n\n## Build your first system quickly, then iterate\n\n[Video #3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/jyWpn/build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate) talks about error analysis before starting out on a new project. Build the first version quickly, then iterate.\n\n- set dev/test set and metric (set the target)\n- build initial system quickly (hit the target)\n- next steps prioritised from bias/variance analysis, error analysis\n\n# Mismatched training and dev/test set\n\n## Training and testing on different distributions\n\n[Video #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/Xs9IV/training-and-testing-on-different-distributions) says deep learning works well on a lot of data, and teams tend to chuck all data they can find into a project. There are some subtleties.\n\nE.g. lots (200K) of data from webpages (professionally shot and framed), and less (10K) data from mobile photography look different (latter is low-res and blurry). If you app focuses on mobile market, you might just want to pay attention to the latter set. But the latter set is smaller. \n\nThings you shouldn't do is combine, randomly shuffle (same distribution) and split. The dev/test will still have a low number of mobile photos.\n\nInstead, do: dev/test set all be mobile images, and the training set could be anything else, with some mobile images.\n\nThe big question is, how many of the mobile images should go into train, and how many into dev/test? \n\nThe recommendation is something like 2K of the mobile-only images into dev/test (because this is the \"real\" data you care about in your app) and 8K mixed in with pro photos in training so that **the training set contains enough REAL data to avoid having a data-mismatch problem**.\n\n## Bias and Variance with mismatched data distributions\n\n[Video #5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/ht85t/bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions) explores the counterpoint where you shouldn't really use all the data you have. E.g. you can have dev and training data from different distributions, but a dev error of 10% and a training error of 1% - how do you know if your algorithm is fine?\n\nTease out these 2 effects (different distribution and variance problem) by **making a new training-dev set**, which has the same distribution as the training set, but is not used for training.\n\nYou could now have training 1%, training-dev 9% and dev 10% errors, and you can now conclude that you have a variance problem (1% - 9%) because training and training-dev are from the same distribution.\n\nYou could now have training 1%, training-dev 1.5% and dev 10% errors, and you can now conclude that you don't have a variance problem, but a **data mismatch problem**.\n\nThe principles are:\n\n![principles](/content/images/2017/11/principles.png)\n\n## Addressing data mismatch\n\nThere aren't very super-systematic things for fixing data mismatch, but [Video #6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/biLiy/addressing-data-mismatch) discusses a few things you can try.\n\nThere might be some tell-tale things related to your application's context which you can focus on to understand the difference between your training and dev/test sets. I.e. for voice navigation apps you can focus on ambient car noise and focus on getting street numbers right. So, collect similar training data, or simulate car noise in related data (e.g. combine audio of car noise with someone querying for a street address). This is called **artificial data synthesis**.\n\nBe careful adding 1 hour of car noise to 10,000 hours of sound clips, because the model might overfit to the car noise. (My intuition: Try modifying the car clip: slow/fast, pitch up/down, generate similar white noise, etc.)\n\nBe careful not to overfit to synthesised data.\n\n# Learning from multiple tasks\n\n## Transfer learning\n\n[Video #7](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/WNPap/transfer-learning) talks about re-purposing your neural networks.\n\nYou can take a network trained for image recognition, and delete the output node and the last set of weights, and randomly initialise those weights and re-train on X-ray data. Or re-train more layers. Or add more layers and and then a new output node.\n\nThis is called **pre-training**, and then using the X-ray data is **fine-tuning**. The image recognition network has learnt a lot about images and the structure of images (lines, dots, curves, etc), and this knowledge might come in useful in the X-ray images.\n\nAnother example is an audio transcript network and **transferring** to a wakeword/triggerword system.\n\nTransfer learning works well if you **have a lot of data for the problem you are transferring from**, but don't have as much data **for the problem you are transferring to**.\n\nIt doesn't work well if your *root stock* had an equal amount or fewer samples that your target samples.\n\n![transfer learning summary](/content/images/2017/11/transfer-learning-summary.png)\n\n## Multi-task learning\n\n[Video #8](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/l9zia/multi-task-learning)\n\nLet's say your autonomous car need to detect these 4 things:\n\n- pedestrians\n- cars\n- stop signs\n- traffic lights\n\n(clearly this is a non-exhaustive list)\n\nWhere previously Y was a `(1,m)` matrix, it is now a `(4,m)` matrix.\n\nUsing this image as an input sample, you can see there's 2 of the 4 features visible: stop sign and car.\n\n![multi-task input sample](/content/images/2017/11/multi-task-input-sample.png)\n\nYou now train a NN to predict these values of Y. Yhat is now a 4 dimensional value for Y. Four output nodes.\n\nUnlike softmax regression, this image can have multiple labels.\n\nYou *could* train 4 networks to predict these 4 things individually, but the base of the network can be shared because you're detecting all objects, so the low-level features at the start of the network can be shared and this NN will give better performance.\n\nFor incomplete/unlabelled samples (e.g. you have training data where they didn't bother to label whether there's a car in the photo or not) you can just omit this term from the summation when calculating the loss.\n\n![multi-task architecture](/content/images/2017/11/multi-task-architecture.png)\n\n![when multi-task makes sense](/content/images/2017/11/when-multi-task-makes-sense.png)\n\n# End-to-end deep learning\n\n## What is end-to-end deep learning?\n\n[Video #9](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/k0Klk/what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning) says that end-to-end is one of the most exciting recent developments in NN. Briefly: deep neural nets replacing previously multi-stage processing systems (sometimes obsoleting entire areas of research previously dedicated to subsystems).\n\nE.g. audio -> MFCC for features -> ML for phonemes -> words -> transcript.\nA NN can just go from audio to transcript.\n\nThe old pipeline works well if you don't have a lot of data, but deep learning trumps multi-stage if you have a lot of data.\n\nHowever, a multi-step approach might work better in some cases. E.g. face recognition. Instead of going from a photo (where the person can be near/far or anywhere in the photo) to identity, instead have stage 1 where you detect where the face is, and stage 2 which takes the zoomed-in face and compares this with all employee photos on file.\n\nSo, this is better because\n\n- each individual problem is simpler and easier to solve\n- you have a lot of data for each of the two subtasks:\n    - there are a lot of photos labelled with WHERE a face is in the photo\n    - there are a lot of photos of faces, and you can add your own labelled as \"employee\" \n\n![face recognition](/content/images/2017/11/face-recognition.png)\n\n## Whether to use end-to-end deep learning\n\n[Video #10](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/H56eb/whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning) discusses what to weight up when deciding whether to use end-to-end or not.\n\n![pros and cons](/content/images/2017/11/pros-and-cons-of-end-to-end.png)\n\nKey question: **do you have sufficient data to learn a function of the complexity needed to map x to y?**\n\nThe Heroes of Deep Learning interviews [feature](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/kR8gk/ruslan-salakhutdinov-interview) [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Salakhutdinov), director of AI research at Apple.\n\nNg poses the PhD VS industry question again, and I like Russ' answer: academia would let you work on anything, any crazy idea, but industry allows you to see first-hand the effect of your work, and you'll have more resources, like compute and multi-disciplinary teams to help in different ways.

There are some subtleties.</p>\n\n<p>E.g. lots (200K) of data from webpages (professionally shot and framed), and less (10K) data from mobile photography look different (latter is low-res and blurry). If you app focuses on mobile market, you might just want to pay attention to the latter set. But the latter set is smaller. </p>\n\n<p>Things you shouldn't do is combine, randomly shuffle (same distribution) and split. The dev/test will still have a low number of mobile photos.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, do: dev/test set all be mobile images, and the training set could be anything else, with some mobile images.</p>\n\n<p>The big question is, how many of the mobile images should go into train, and how many into dev/test? </p>\n\n<p>The recommendation is something like 2K of the mobile-only images into dev/test (because this is the \"real\" data you care about in your app) and 8K mixed in with pro photos in training so that <strong>the training set contains enough REAL data to avoid having a data-mismatch problem</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"biasandvariancewithmismatcheddatadistributions\">Bias and Variance with mismatched data distributions</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/ht85t/bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions\">Video #5</a> explores the counterpoint where you shouldn't really use all the data you have.

I.e. for voice navigation apps you can focus on ambient car noise and focus on getting street numbers right. So, collect similar training data, or simulate car noise in related data (e.g. combine audio of car noise with someone querying for a street address). This is called <strong>artificial data synthesis</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful adding 1 hour of car noise to 10,000 hours of sound clips, because the model might overfit to the car noise. (My intuition: Try modifying the car clip: slow/fast, pitch up/down, generate similar white noise, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Be careful not to overfit to synthesised data.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"learningfrommultipletasks\">Learning from multiple tasks</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"transferlearning\">Transfer learning</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/WNPap/transfer-learning\">Video #7</a> talks about re-purposing your neural networks.</p>\n\n<p>You can take a network trained for image recognition, and delete the output node and the last set of weights, and randomly initialise those weights and re-train on X-ray data. Or re-train more layers. Or add more layers and and then a new output node.</p>\n\n<p>This is called <strong>pre-training</strong>, and then using the X-ray data is <strong>fine-tuning</strong>. The image recognition network has learnt a lot about images and the structure of images (lines, dots, curves, etc), and this knowledge might come in useful in the X-ray images.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is an audio transcript network and <strong>transferring</strong> to a wakeword/triggerword system.</p>\n\n<p>Transfer learning works well if you <strong>have a lot of data for the problem you are transferring from</strong>, but don't have as much data <strong>for the problem you are transferring to</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't work well if your <em>root stock</em> had an equal amount or fewer samples that your target samples.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/transfer-learning-summary.png\" alt=\"transfer learning summary\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"multitasklearning\">Multi-task learning</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/lecture/l9zia/multi-task-learning\">Video #8</a></p>\n\n<p>Let's say your autonomous car need to detect these 4 things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>pedestrians</li>\n<li>cars</li>\n<li>stop signs</li>\n<li>traffic lights</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(clearly this is a non-exhaustive list)</p>\n\n<p>Where previously Y was a <code>(1,m)</code> matrix, it is now a <code>(4,m)</code> matrix.</p>\n\n<p>Using this image as an input sample, you can see there's 2 of the 4 features visible: stop sign and car.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/multi-task-input-sample.png\" alt=\"multi-task input sample\" /></p>\n\n<p>You now train a NN to predict these values of Y.

E.g. face recognition.

Intuitions doesn't always transfer across applications (e.g. from image recog to speech transcript).\n\nSetting up your data sets well will help with quicker iterations.\n\nHold-out / cross-validation set is aka dev set.\n\nDev set just needs to be big enough to evaluate algo choices.\n\nTest set gives you an unbiased estimate of algo performance, but you might not always need one.\n\n## Bias / Variance\n\n[Video #2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/ZhclI/bias-variance) says that in the deep learning era there's less of the so-called \"bias-variance trade-off\".\n\n![bias and variance](/content/images/2017/11/bias-and-variance.png)\n\nSome notes from course 3 in the specialisation apply here.\n\n![having both problems](/content/images/2017/11/high-bias-and-high-variance.png)\n\n## Basic Recipe for Machine Learning\n\n[Video #3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/ZBkx4/basic-recipe-for-machine-learning) talks about the basic recipe for the high bias/high variance issue.\n\n![recipe](/content/images/2017/11/recipe.png)\n\nTraining a bigger network almost never hurts variance, as long as you regularise properly.\n\nAlso, in deep learning you don't have the bias/variance \"trade-off\".\n\n# Regularizing your neural network\n\n## Regularization\n\n[Video #4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/Srsrc/regularization) says regularisation is the first thing to try when you're overfitting or have high variance, because more data might not always be available.\n\n### L2 in logistic regression\n\nYou add to your cost function the *regularisation parameter* lambda:\n\n`λ/2m ||w||^2` where the norm of w squared is just a squared Euclidian norm (or L2 norm), also written `W.T * W`. This is called **L2 regularisation**.\n\nYou could add a similar parameter for *b*.\n\nThere's also L1 reg, and it's \"sparse\" so could compress your model, but in practice L2 is used more often as L1 helps only a bit.\n\nλ is another hyperparameter that you have to tune.\n\n![L2 reg](/content/images/2017/11/l2-reg.png)\n\n### L2 in a neural network\n\nFor cost, same as before, but summing over the weight norms. It's called the \"Frobenius norm\" of a matrix.\n\nFor `dw`, you're adding `λ/m * W` to `dw`, and in gradient descent this is called *weight decay*.\n\n![L2 reg in NN](/content/images/2017/11/l2-reg-nn.png)\n\n### Summary \n\n![summary of L2](/content/images/2017/11/summary-of-L2.png)\n\n### What is L2-regularization actually doing?\n\nL2-regularization relies on the assumption that a model with small weights is simpler than a model with large weights. Thus, by penalizing the square values of the weights in the cost function you drive all the weights to smaller values (weight decay). It becomes too costly for the cost to have large weights! This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes.\n\n## Why regularization reduces overfitting?\n\n[Video #5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/T6OJj/why-regularization-reduces-overfitting) explains the intuition for why L2 reduces overfitting.\n\n### Intuition 1\n\nIn this diagram, making λ high will make the weights go to zero, which means your network starts looking like a logistic regression unit which looks more like the high bias fit on the left, so there'll be an intermediate value for λ which gives you the \"just right\" fit in the middle.\n\n![just right](/content/images/2017/11/just-right.png)\n\nActually, it doesn't really zero-out a lot of weight, but their effects are just softened.\n\n### Intuition 2\n\nLarge λ means small W which means a small Z, so it takes on a small range of values (the linear bit in tanh, if your activation is tanh) so you end up with a linear network, which is something straighter than the overfit squiggly line on the right in the image above.\n\n![L2 intuition 2](/content/images/2017/11/l2-intuition-2.png)\n\nDebugging L2 could involve plotting the cost (against iterations) with and without L2, and verifying that the old cost doesn't decrease monotonically.\n\n![debugging L2](/content/images/2017/11/debugging-L2.png)\n\n\n## Dropout Regularization\n\n[Video #6](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/eM33A/dropout-regularization) starts with an illustration: you disable nodes randomly to end up with a diminished network for every iteration over all samples (don't randomly change per sample!).\n\n![dropout-to-diminish](/content/images/2017/11/dropout.png)\n\nThe recommended way to implement dropout is \"inverted dropout\": keep `keep_prob` percentage of weights, but bump the activation back up by dividing by `keep_prob` and it ensures that the expected value of *a* remains the same:\n\n![inverted](/content/images/2017/11/inverted.png)\n\n## Understanding Dropout\n\n[Video #7](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/YaGbR/understanding-dropout) says dropout gives you a smaller network, and that has a regularising effect.\n\nIntuition: you can't rely on any one feature, so you have to spread out the weights.\n\nDropout has a similar effect to L2 reg in the sense that when a weight is disabled, it has the effect of spreading out and in effect shrinking the squared norm of the weights.\n\nYou can also vary `keep_prob` by layer (although this increases the hyperparam space). `keep_prob` of 1 also means that nothing is dropping out; you're keeping everything.\n\nThe downside of dropout is that the cost function J now isn't very well defined because on every iteration you're randomly killing off nodes. You lose the plot debugging discussed previously. You can plot first with `keep_prob=1` and ensure it decreases monotonically, and only then introduce dropout and ensure you haven't introduced bugs.\n\n![why-dropout-works](/content/images/2017/11/why-dropout-works.png)\n\n### Remember this about dropout\n\n- A **common mistake** when using dropout is to use it both in training and testing. You should use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) only in training.\n- Deep learning frameworks like [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dropout), [PaddlePaddle](http://doc.paddlepaddle.org/release_doc/0.9.0/doc/ui/api/trainer_config_helpers/attrs.html), [keras](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout) or [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/layers/dropout.html) which we'll learn about in due course.\n- Dropout is a regularization technique.\nYou only use dropout during training. -\n- Don't use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) during test time.\n- Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.\n- During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep_prob to keep the same expected value for the activations. For example, if keep_prob is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep_prob is other values than 0.5.\n\nNote that regularization hurts training set performance! This is because it limits the ability of the network to overfit to the training set. But since it ultimately gives better test accuracy, it is helping your system.\n\n## Other regularization methods\n\n[Video #8](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/Pa53F/other-regularization-methods) discusses a few more techniques.\n\n### Data augmentation\n\nE.g. flip images horizontally, random crops, random zooms, distortions, transformations. It's an inexpensive way to get more data, regularise, and reduce overfitting.\n\n### Early stopping\n\n![early stopping](/content/images/2017/11/early-stopping.png)\n\n\n...but it's not orthogonal, in the sense that you're changing two things:\n\n- reducing the cost\n- not overfitting\n\nBest just to use L2 and not stop.\n\n# Setting up your optimization problem\n\n## Normalizing inputs\n\n[Video #9](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/lXv6U/normalizing-inputs)\n\n\nStep 1: Subtract (or zero-out) the mean.\nStep 2: normalise the variances\n\nUse the same *mu* and *sigma squared* in the test set.\n\n![normalise](/content/images/2017/11/normalise.png)\n\nWhy do we normalise? It will speed up gradient descent.\n\nThe illustration below doesn't apply to high-dimensional weights, but it's a good intuition in 2D.\n\n![why normalise](/content/images/2017/11/why-normalise.png)\n\nThis type of normalisation doesn't hurt, so we do it anyway.\n\n## Vanishing / Exploding gradients\n\n[Video #10](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/C9iQO/vanishing-exploding-gradients) says that \"exploding gradients\" are when they get very big or very small, and this makes training difficult. This is alleviated by careful weight random initialisation.\n\n![vanishing and exploding gradients](/content/images/2017/11/vanishing-and-exploding-gradients.png)\n\nThe amount of layers *L*, when large, has this effect on your gradients if *W*\n\n- is slightly smaller (than one, or) than the identity matrix (e.g. 0.9), then your gradients vanish\n- is slightly larger than the identity matrix, then your gradients (or activations) can explode\n\n## Weight Initialization for Deep Networks\n\n[Video #11](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/RwqYe/weight-initialization-for-deep-networks) talks about weight initialisation.\n\n### Single neuron example\n\nWhen using ReLU, one reasonable thing to do is set the variance of *Wi* to be equal to 2 over n, where n is the number of input features into the neuron (this is \"He\" initialisation). For tanh there's Xavier initialisation, and then there's another one invented by Bengio.\n\n![single neuron example](/content/images/2017/11/single-neuron-example.png)\n\nThe variance parameter becomes another hyperparameter.\n\n## Numerical approximation of gradients\n\n[Video #12](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/XzSSa/numerical-approximation-of-gradients) says when you implement back propagation you'll find that there's a test called *gradient checking* that can really help you make sure that your implementation of back prop is correct.\n\nIt takes a \"2 sided difference\" of the gradient, which turns out to be more accurate:\n\n![2-sided](/content/images/2017/11/2-sided.png)\n\nThe math showing the 1-sided difference being less accurate (0.01 as opposed to 0.0001 for 2-sided)\n\n![2 sided math](/content/images/2017/11/2-sided-math.png)\n\nWe'll use this to do gradient checking in the next section.\n\n## Gradient checking\n\n[Video #13](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/htA0l/gradient-checking) says to concatenate W1, b1, ... WL, bL into a vector theta. Do the same for dW1, db1, ..., dWL, dbL into a vector d-theta. They will have the same size.\n\nNow check if is d-theta the gradient of the cost function J of theta.\n\n![gradient check](/content/images/2017/11/gradient-check.png)\n\nFor each component of theta *i* compute d-theta-approx-i with the two-sided difference. That's J of theta, theta-1, theta-2, up to theta-i. And we're going to nudge theta-i and add/minus epsilon to it. Just nudge theta i by epsilon, and keep everything else the same.\n\nThe video then shows the values for epsilon in the check where you should start worrying about bugs, i.e. if d-theta is very far away from d-approx-i.\n\n![grad check](/content/images/2017/11/grad-check.png)\n\n### Summary\n\n![another gradient checking summary](/content/images/2017/11/another-gradient-checking-summary.png)\n\n## Gradient Checking Implementation Notes\n\n[Video #14](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/6igIc/gradient-checking-implementation-notes) notes some things when implementing gradient checking.\n\n![when implementing gradient checking](/content/images/2017/11/when-implementing-gradient-checking.png)\n\n### Things to note\n\n\n- Gradient Checking is slow! Approximating the gradient with  `∂J∂θ≈J(θ+ε)−J(θ−ε)2ε∂J∂θ ≈ J(θ+ε)−J(θ−ε)2ε`  is computationally costly. For this reason, we don't run gradient checking at every iteration during training. Just a few times to check if the gradient is correct.\n- Gradient Checking, at least as we've presented it, doesn't work with dropout. You would usually run the gradient check algorithm without dropout to make sure your backprop is correct, then add dropout.\n\n# Heroes of Deep Learning\n\n[Interview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/bqUgf/yoshua-bengio-interview) with [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio)","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>This is my series on the 4-week course called (breathes in) <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome\">Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"settingupyourmachinelearningapplication\">Setting up your Machine Learning Application</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"traindevtestsets\">Train / Dev / Test sets</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/cxG1s/train-dev-test-sets\">Video #1</a> says choosing the right values for hyperparameters are hard, so just start and iterate.

This is called <strong>L2 regularisation</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You could add a similar parameter for <em>b</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There's also L1 reg, and it's \"sparse\" so could compress your model, but in practice L2 is used more often as L1 helps only a bit.</p>\n\n<p>λ is another hyperparameter that you have to tune.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/l2-reg.png\" alt=\"L2 reg\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"l2inaneuralnetwork\">L2 in a neural network</h3>\n\n<p>For cost, same as before, but summing over the weight norms.

Thus, by penalizing the square values of the weights in the cost function you drive all the weights to smaller values (weight decay). It becomes too costly for the cost to have large weights! This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whyregularizationreducesoverfitting\">Why regularization reduces overfitting?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/T6OJj/why-regularization-reduces-overfitting\">Video #5</a> explains the intuition for why L2 reduces overfitting.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"intuition1\">Intuition 1</h3>\n\n<p>In this diagram, making λ high will make the weights go to zero, which means your network starts looking like a logistic regression unit which looks more like the high bias fit on the left, so there'll be an intermediate value for λ which gives you the \"just right\" fit in the middle.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/just-right.png\" alt=\"just right\" /></p>\n\n<p>Actually, it doesn't really zero-out a lot of weight, but their effects are just softened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"intuition2\">Intuition 2</h3>\n\n<p>Large λ means small W which means a small Z, so it takes on a small range of values (the linear bit in tanh, if your activation is tanh) so you end up with a linear network, which is something straighter than the overfit squiggly line on the right in the image above.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/l2-intuition-2.png\" alt=\"L2 intuition 2\" /></p>\n\n<p>Debugging L2 could involve plotting the cost (against iterations) with and without L2, and verifying that the old cost doesn't decrease monotonically.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/debugging-L2.png\" alt=\"debugging L2\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dropoutregularization\">Dropout Regularization</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/eM33A/dropout-regularization\">Video #6</a> starts with an illustration: you disable nodes randomly to end up with a diminished network for every iteration over all samples (don't randomly change per sample!).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/dropout.png\" alt=\"dropout-to-diminish\" /></p>\n\n<p>The recommended way to implement dropout is \"inverted dropout\": keep <code>keep_prob</code> percentage of weights, but bump the activation back up by dividing by <code>keep_prob</code> and it ensures that the expected value of <em>a</em> remains the same:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/inverted.png\" alt=\"inverted\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understandingdropout\">Understanding Dropout</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/YaGbR/understanding-dropout\">Video #7</a> says dropout gives you a smaller network, and that has a regularising effect.</p>\n\n<p>Intuition: you can't rely on any one feature, so you have to spread out the weights.</p>\n\n<p>Dropout has a similar effect to L2 reg in the sense that when a weight is disabled, it has the effect of spreading out and in effect shrinking the squared norm of the weights.</p>\n\n<p>You can also vary <code>keep_prob</code> by layer (although this increases the hyperparam space). <code>keep_prob</code> of 1 also means that nothing is dropping out; you're keeping everything.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of dropout is that the cost function J now isn't very well defined because on every iteration you're randomly killing off nodes. You lose the plot debugging discussed previously. You can plot first with <code>keep_prob=1</code> and ensure it decreases monotonically, and only then introduce dropout and ensure you haven't introduced bugs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/why-dropout-works.png\" alt=\"why-dropout-works\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rememberthisaboutdropout\">Remember this about dropout</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>common mistake</strong> when using dropout is to use it both in training and testing. You should use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) only in training.</li>\n<li>Deep learning frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dropout\">tensorflow</a>, <a href=\"http://doc.paddlepaddle.org/release_doc/0.9.0/doc/ui/api/trainer_config_helpers/attrs.html\">PaddlePaddle</a>, <a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout\">keras</a> or <a href=\"http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/layers/dropout.html\">caffe</a> which we'll learn about in due course.</li>\n<li>Dropout is a regularization technique.\nYou only use dropout during training. -  </li>\n<li>Don't use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) during test time.</li>\n<li>Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.</li>\n<li>During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep<em>prob to keep the same expected value for the activations. For example, if keep</em>prob is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep_prob is other values than 0.5.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that regularization hurts training set performance! This is because it limits the ability of the network to overfit to the training set. But since it ultimately gives better test accuracy, it is helping your system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"otherregularizationmethods\">Other regularization methods</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/Pa53F/other-regularization-methods\">Video #8</a> discusses a few more techniques.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dataaugmentation\">Data augmentation</h3>\n\n<p>E.g. flip images horizontally, random crops, random zooms, distortions, transformations.
